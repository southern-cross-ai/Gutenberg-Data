  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I. &mdash; OUT OF THE STORM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was a miserable night which brought me first in touch
  with Jason Croft. There was a rain and enough wind to send it in gusty dashes
  against the windows. It was the sort of a night when I always felt glad to
  cast off coat and shoes, don a robe and slippers, and sit down with the
  curtains drawn, a lighted pipe, and the soft glow of a lamp falling across
  the pages of my book. I am, I admit, always strangely susceptible to the
  shut-in sense of comfort afforded by a pipe, the steady yellow of a light,
  and the magic of printed lines at a time of elemental turmoil and stress.</p>

  <p>It was with a feeling little short of and shoes, don a robe and slippers,
  and sit down with the curtains drawn, a lighted pipe, and the soft glow of a
  lamp falling across the pages of my book. I am, I admit, always strangely
  susceptible to the shut-in sense of comfort afforded by a pipe, the steady
  yellow of a light, and the magic of printed lines at a time of elemental
  turmoil and stress.</p>

  <p>It was with a feeling little short of opened the outer door, to reveal the
  figure of an old woman, somewhat stooping, her head covered by a shawl, which
  sloped wetly from her head to either shoulder, and was caught and held
  beneath her chin by one bony hand.</p>

  <p>"Doctor," she began in a tone of almost frantic excitement. "Dr.
  Murray&mdash;come quick!"</p>

  <p>Perhaps I may as well introduce my-self here as anywhere else. I am Dr.
  George Murray, still, as at the time of which I write, in charge of the State
  Mental Hospital in a Western State. The institution was not then very large,
  and since taking my position at the head of its staff I had found myself with
  considerable time for my study along the lines of human psychology and the
  various powers and aberrations of the mind.</p>

  <p>Also, I may as well confess, as a first step toward a better understanding
  of my part in what followed, that for years before coming to the asylum I had
  delved more or less deeply into such studies, seeking to learn what I might
  concerning both the normal and the abnormal manifestations of mental
  force.</p>

  <p>There is good reading and highly entertaining, I assure you, in the
  various philosophies dealing with life, religion, and the several beliefs
  regarding the soul of man. I was therefore fairly conversant not only with
  the Occidental creeds, but with those of the Oriental races as well. And I
  knew that certain of the Eastern sects had advanced in their knowledge far
  beyond our Western world. I had even endeavored to make their knowledge mine,
  so far as I could, in certain lines at least, and had from time to time
  applied some of-that knowledge to the treatment of cases in the institution
  of which I was the head.</p>

  <p>But I was not thinking of anything like that as I looked at the
  shawl-wrapped face of the little bent woman, wrinkled and wry enough to have
  been a very part of the storm which beat about her and blew back the skirts
  of my lounging-robe and chilled my ankles. I lived in a residence detached
  from the asylum buildings proper, but none the less a part of the
  institution; and, as a matter of fact, my sole thought was a feeling of
  surprise that any one should have come here to find me, and despite the
  woman's manifest state of anxiety and haste, a decided reluctance to go with
  her quickly or otherwise on such a night.</p>

  <p>I rather temporized: "But, my dear woman, surely there are other doctors
  for you to call. I am really not in general practice. I am connected with the
  asylum&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And that is the very reason I always said I would come for you if
  anything happened to Mr. Jason," she cut in.</p>

  <p>"Whom?" I inquired, interested in spite of myself at this plainly
  premeditated demand for my service.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Jason Croft, sir," she returned. "He's dead maybe&mdash;I dunno. But
  he's been that way for a week."</p>

  <p>"Dead?" I exclaimed in almost an involuntary fashion, startled by her
  words.</p>

  <p>"Dead, or asleep. I don't know which."</p>

  <p>Clearly there was something here I wasn't getting into fully, and my
  interest was aroused. The whole affair seemed to be taking on an atmosphere
  of the peculiar, and it was equally clear that the gusty doorway was no place
  to talk.</p>

  <p>"Come in," I said. "What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"Goss," said she, without making any move to enter. "I'm housekeeper for
  Mr. Jason, but I'll not be comin' in unless you say you'll go."</p>

  <p>"Then come in without any more delay," I replied, making up my mind. I
  knew Croft in a way&mdash;by sight at least. He was a big fellow with light
  hair and a splendid physique, who had been pointed out to me shortly after my
  arrival. Once I had even got close enough to the man to look into his eyes.
  They were gray, and held a peculiar something in their gaze which had
  arrested my attention at once. Jason Croft had the eyes of a mystic&mdash;of
  a student of those very things I myself had studied more or less.</p>

  <p>They were the eyes of one who saw deeper than the mere objective surface
  of life, and the old woman's words at the last had waked up my interest in no
  uncertain degree. I had decided I would go with her to Croft's house, which
  was not very far down the street, and see, if I might, for myself just what
  had occurred to send her rushing to me through the night.</p>

  <p>I gave her a seat, said I would get on my shoes and coat, and went back
  into the room I had left some moments before. There I dressed quickly for my
  venture into the storm, adding a raincoat to my other attire, and was back in
  the hall inside five minutes at most.</p>

  <p>WE set out at once, emerging into the wind-driven rain, my long raincoat
  flapping about my legs and the little old woman tottering along at my side.
  And what with the rain, the wind, and the unexpected summons, I found myself
  in a rather strange frame of mind. The whole thing seemed more like some
  story I had read than a happening of real life, particularly so as my
  companion kept pace with me and uttered no sound save at times a rather
  rasping sort of breath. The whole thing became an almost eery experience as
  we hastened down the storm-swept street.</p>

  <p>Then we turned in at a gate and went up toward the large house I knew to
  be Croft's, and the little old woman unlocked a heavy front door and led me
  into a hall. It was a most unusual hall, too, its walls draped with rare
  tapestries and rugs, its floor covered with other rugs such as I had never
  seen outside private collections, lighted by a hammered brass lantern through
  the pierced sides of which the rays of an electric light shone forth.</p>

  <p>Across the hall she scuttered, still in evident haste, and flung open a
  door to permit me to enter a room which was plainly a study. It was lined
  with cases of books, furnished richly yet plainly with chairs, a heavy desk,
  and a broad couch, on which I saw in one swift glance the stretched-out body
  of Croft himself.</p>

  <p>He lay wholly relaxed, like one sunk in heavy sleep, his eyelids closed,
  his arms and hands dropped limply at his sides, but with no visible sign of
  respiration animating his deep full chest.</p>

  <p>Toward him the little woman gestured with a hand, and stood watching,
  still with her wet shawl about her head and shoulders, while I approached and
  bent over the man.</p>

  <p>I touched his face and found it cold. My fingers sought his pulse and
  failed to find it at all. But his body was limp as I lifted an arm and
  dropped it. There was no rigor, yet there was no evidence of decay, such as
  must follow once rigor has passed away. I had brought instruments with me as
  a matter of course. I took them from my pocket and listened for some sound
  from the heart. I thought I found the barest flutter, but I wasn't sure. I
  tested the tension of the eye-ball under the closed lids and found it firm. I
  straightened and turned to face the little old woman.</p>

  <p>"Dead, sir?" she asked in a sibilant whisper. Her eyes were wide in their
  sockets. They stared into mine.</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "He doesn't appear to be dead," I replied. "See here,
  Mrs. Goss, what did you mean by saying he ought to have been back three days
  ago? What do you mean by back?"</p>

  <p>She fingered at her lips with one bony hand. "Why&mdash;awake, sir," she
  said at last.</p>

  <p>"Then why didn't you say so?" I snapped. "Why use the word back?"</p>

  <p>"Because, sir," she faltered, "that's what he says when he wakes up.
  'Well, Mary, I'm back.' I&mdash;I guess I just said it because he does,
  doctor. I was worrit when he didn't come back&mdash;when he didn't wake up,
  to-night, an' it took to rainin'. I reckon maybe it was th' storm scared me,
  sir."</p>

  <p>Her words had, however, given me a clue. "He's been like this before,
  then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. But never more than four days without telling me he would. Th'
  first time was months ago&mdash;but it's been gettin' oftener and oftener,
  till now all his sleeps are like this. He told me not to be scared&mdash;an'
  to&mdash;to never bother about him&mdash;to&mdash; to just let him alone;
  but&mdash;I guess I was scared tonight, when it begun to storm an' him layin'
  there like that. It was like havin' a corpse in the house."</p>

  <p>I began to gain a fuller appreciation of the situation. I myself had seen
  people in a cataleptic condition, had even induced the state in subjects
  myself, and it appeared to me that Jason Croft was in a similar state, no
  matter how induced.</p>

  <p>"What does your employer do?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"He studies, sir&mdash;just studies things like that." Mrs. Goss gestured
  at the cases of books. "He don't have to work, you know. His uncle left him
  rich."</p>

  <p>I followed her arm as she swept it about the glass-fronted cases. I
  brought my glances back to the desk in the center of the room, between the
  woman and myself as we stood. Upon it I spied another volume lying open. It
  was unlike any book I had ever seen, yellowed with age; in fact not a book at
  all, but a series of parchment pages tied together with bits of silken
  cord.</p>

  <p>I took the thing up and found the open pages covered with marginal notes
  in English although the original was plainly in Sanskrit, an ancient language
  I had seen before, but was wholly unable to read. The notations, however,
  threw some light into my mind, and as I read them I forgot the storm, the
  little old woman&mdash;everything save what I read and the bearing it held on
  the man behind me on the couch. I felt sure they had been written by his own
  hand, and they bore on the subject of astral projection&mdash; the ability of
  the soul to separate itself, or be separated, from the physical body and
  return to its fleshy husk again at will.</p>

  <p>I finished the open pages and turned to others. The notations were still
  present wherever I looked. At last I turned to the very front and found that
  the manuscript was by Ahmid, an occult adept of Hindustan, who lived
  somewhere in the second or third century of the Christian era.</p>

  <p>With a strange sensation I laid down the silk-bound pages. They were very,
  very old. Over a thousand years had come and passed since they were written
  by the dead Ahmid's hand. Yet I had held them to-night, and I felt sure Jason
  Croft had held them often&mdash; read them and understood them, and that the
  condition in which I found him this night was in some way subtly connected
  with their store of ancient lore. And suddenly I sensed the storm and the
  little old woman and the silent body of the man at my back again, with a
  feeling of something uncanny in the whole affair.</p>

  <p>"You can do nothing for him?" the woman broke my introspection.</p>

  <p>I looked up and into her eyes, dark and bright and questioning as she
  stood still clutching her damp shawl.</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure of that," I said. "But&mdash;Mr. Croft's condition is
  rather&mdash;peculiar. Whatever I do will require quiet&mdash;that I am alone
  with him for some time. I think if I can be left here with him for possibly
  an hour, I can bring him back."</p>

  <p>I paused abruptly. I had used the woman's former words almost. And I saw
  she noticed the fact, for a slight smile gathered on her faded lips. She
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"You'll bring him back," she said. "Mind you, doctor, th' trouble is with
  Mr. Jason's head, I've been thinking. 'Twas for that I've been telling myself
  I would come for you, if he forgot to come back some time, like I've been
  afraid he would."</p>

  <p>"You did quite right," I agreed. "But&mdash;the trouble is not with Mr.
  Croft's mind. In fact, Mrs. Goss, I believe he is a very learned man. How
  long have you known him, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>"Ever since he was a boy, except when he was travelin'," she returned.</p>

  <p>"He has traveled?" I took her up.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, a lot. Me an' my husband kept up th' place while he was
  gone."</p>

  <p>"I see," I said. "And now if you will let me try what I can do."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. I'll set out in th' hall," she agreed, and turned in her rapid
  putter from the room.</p>

  <p>Left alone, I took a chair, dragged it to the side of the couch, and
  studied my man.</p>

  <p>So far as I could judge, he was at least six feet tall, and
  correspondingly built. His hair was heavy, almost tawny, and, as I knew, his
  eyes were gray. The whole contour of his head and features showed what
  appeared to me remarkable intelligence and strength, the nose finely
  chiseled, the mouth well-formed and firm, the chin unmistakably strong. That
  Croft was an unusual character I felt more and more as I sat there. His very
  condition, which, from what I had learned from the little old woman and his
  own notation on the margins of Ahmid's writings, I believed self-induced,
  would certainly indicate that. But my own years of study had taught me no
  little of hypnosis, suggestion, and the various phases of the subconscious
  mind. I had developed no little power with various patients, or "subjects,"
  as a hypnotist calls them, who from time to time had submitted themselves to
  my control. Wherefore I felt that I knew about what to do to waken the
  sleeping objective mind of the man on the couch. I had asked for an hour, and
  the time had been granted. It behooved me to get to work.</p>

  <p>I began. I concentrated my mind to the exclusion of all else upon my task,
  sending a mental call to the soul of Jason Croft, wherever it might be,
  commanding it to return to the body it had temporarily quitted of its own
  volition, and once more animate it to a conscious life. I forgot the
  strangeness of the situation, the rattle of the rain against the glass panes
  of the room. And after a time I began speaking to the form beside which I sat
  as to a conscious person, firmly repeating over and over my demand for the
  presence of Jason Croft&mdash;demanding it, nor letting myself doubt for a
  single instant that the demand would be given heed in time.</p>

  <p>It was a nerve-racking task. In the end it came to seem that I sat there
  and struggled against some intangible, invisible force which resisted all my
  efforts. I look back now on the time spent there that night as an ordeal such
  as I never desire to again attempt. But I did not desist. I had asked for an
  hour, because when I asked I never dreamed the thing I had attempted, the
  thing which is yet to be related, concerning the weird, yet true narrative,
  as I fully believe, of Jason Croft.</p>

  <p>I had then no conception of how far his venturesome spirit had plumbed the
  universe. If I thought of him at all, it was merely as some experimenter who
  might have need of help rather than as an adept of adepts, who had
  transcended all human accomplishments in his line of research and
  thought.</p>

  <p>In my own blindness I had fancied that his overlong period in his
  cataleptic trance might even be due to some inability on his part to
  reanimate his own body, after leaving it where it lay. I thought of myself as
  possibly aiding him in the task by what I would do in the time for which I
  had asked.</p>

  <p>But the hour ran away, and another, and still the body over which I worked
  lay as it had lain at first, nor gave any sign of any effect of my
  concentrated will. It had been close to ten when I came to the house. It was
  three in the morning when I gained my first reward. And when it came, it was
  so sudden that I actually started back in my chair and sat clutching its
  carved arms, and staring in something almost like horror, I think, at first
  at the body which had lifted itself to a sitting posture on the couch.</p>

  <p>And I know that when the man said, "So you are the one who called me
  back?" I actually gasped before I answered:</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Croft fastened his eyes upon me in a steady regard. "You are Dr. Murray,
  from the Mental Hospital, are you not?" he went on.</p>

  <p>"Ye-es," I stammered again. Mrs. Goss had said his sleep was like having a
  corpse about the house. I found myself thinking this was nearly as though a
  corpse should rise up and speak.</p>

  <p>But he nodded, with the barest smile on his lips. "Only one acquainted
  with the nature of my condition could have roused me," he said. "However, you
  were engaging in a dangerous undertaking, friend."</p>

  <p>"Dangerous for you, you mean," I rejoined. "Do you know you have lain
  cataleptic for something like a week?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." He nodded again. "But I was occupied on a most important
  mission."</p>

  <p>"Occupied!" I exclaimed. "You mean you were engaged in some undertaking
  while you lay there?" I pointed to the couch where he sat.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Once more he smiled.</p>

  <p>Well, the man was sane. In fact, it seemed to me in those first few
  moments that he was far saner than I, far less excited, far less affected by
  the whole business from the-first to last. In fact, he seemed quite calm and
  a trifle amused, while I was admittedly upset. And my very knowledge gained
  by years of study told me he was sane, that his was a perfectly balanced
  brain. There was nothing about him to even hint at anything else, save his
  extraordinary words. In the end I continued with a question:</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"On the planet Palos, one of the Dog Star pack&mdash;a star in the system
  of the sun Sirius," he replied.</p>

  <p>"And you mean you have just returned from&mdash;there?" I faltered over
  the last word badly. My brain seemed slightly dazed at the astounding
  statement he had made&mdash;that I&mdash;I had called him from a planet
  beyond the ken of the naked eye, known only to those who studied the heavens
  with powerful glasses&mdash;farther away than any star of our own earthly
  system of planets. The thing made my senses reel.</p>

  <p>And he seemed to sense my emotions, because he went on in a softly
  modulated tone: "Do not think me in any way similar to those unfortunates
  under your charge. As an alienist you must know the truth of that, just as
  you knew that my trance-like sleep was wholly self-induced."</p>

  <p>"I gathered that from the volume on your desk," I explained.</p>

  <p>He glanced toward Ahmid's work. "You read the Sanskrit?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "No, I read the marginal notes."</p>

  <p>"I see. Who called you here?"</p>

  <p>I explained.</p>

  <p>Croft frowned. "I cannot blame her; she is a faithful soul," he remarked.
  "I can comprehend her worry. I have explained to her as fully as I dared,
  but&mdash;she does not understand, and I remained away longer than I really
  intended, to tell the truth. However, now that you can reassure her, I must
  ask you to excuse me, doctor, for a while. Come to me in about twelve hours
  and I will be here to meet you and explain in part at least."</p>

  <p>He stretched himself out once more on the couch.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" I cried. "What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I am going back to Palos," he told me with a smile.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;will your body stand the strain?" I questioned, beginning to
  doubt his sanity after all.</p>

  <p>He met my objection with another smile. "I have studied that well before I
  began these little excursions of mine. Meet me at, say, four o'clock this
  afternoon." He appeared to relax, sighed softly, and sank again into his
  trance.</p>

  <p>I sprang up and stood looking down upon him. I hardly knew what to do. I
  began pacing the floor. Finally I gave my attention to the books in the cases
  which lined the room. They comprised the most wonderful collection of works
  on the occult ever gathered within four walls. They helped me to make up my
  mind in the end. I decided to take Jason Croft at his word and keep the
  engagement tor the coming afternoon. I went to the study door and set it
  open. The little old woman sat huddled on a chair. At first I thought she
  slept, but almost at once I found her bright eyes upon me, and she started to
  her feet.</p>

  <p>"He came back&mdash;I&mdash;I heard him speaking," she began in a husky
  whisper. "He&mdash;is he all right?"</p>

  <p>"All right," I replied. "But he is asleep again now and has promised to
  see me this afternoon at four. In the meantime do not attempt to disturb him
  in any way, Mrs. Goss."</p>

  <p>She nodded. Suddenly she seemed wholly satisfied. "I won't, sir," she gave
  her promise. "I was worrit&mdash;worrit-that was all."</p>

  <p>"You need not worry any more," I sought to reassure her. "I fancy Mr.
  Croft is able to take care of himself."</p>

  <p>And, oddly enough, I found myself believing my own words as I went down
  the steps and turned toward my own home to get what sleep I
  could&mdash;since, to tell the truth, I felt utterly exhausted after my
  efforts to call Jason Croft back from&mdash;the planet of, a distant sun.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II. &mdash; A COUNTRY IN THE CLOUDS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AND yet when I woke in the morning and went about my duties
  at the asylum, I confess the events of the night before seemed rather unreal.
  I began to half fancy myself the victim of some sort of hoax. I did not doubt
  that Croft had been up to some psychic experiment when his old servant, Mrs.
  Goss, had become alarmed and brought me into the situation. But&mdash;I felt
  inclined to believe that after I had waked him from his self-induced trance
  he had deliberately turned the conversation into a channel which would give
  me a mental jolt before he had calmly gone back to sleep. I knew something of
  the occult, of course, but I was hardly ready to credit the rather lurid
  statement he had made. Before noon I was smiling at myself, and determining
  to keep my appointment with him for the afternoon, and show him from the
  start that I was not so complete a fool as I had seemed.</p>

  <p>Hence it was with a resolve not to be swept off my feet by any unusual
  fabrication of his devising that I approached his house at about three
  o'clock and turned in from the street to his porch.</p>

  <p>He sat there, in a wicker chair, smoking an excellent cigar. No doubt but
  he had recovered completely from the state in which I had beheld him first.
  He rose as I mounted the steps and put out a hand.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Dr. Murray," he greeted me with a smile. "I have been waiting your
  coming. Let me offer you a chair and a smoke while we talk."</p>

  <p>We shook hands, and then I sat down and lighted the mate of the cigar
  Croft held between his strong, even teeth. Then, as I threw away the match, I
  looked straight into his eyes. And, believe me or not, it was as though the
  man read my thoughts.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "I really told you the truth, Murray, you know," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"About&mdash;Palos?" I smiled.</p>

  <p>He nodded. "Yes, I was really there, and&mdash;I went back after we had
  our talk."</p>

  <p>"Rather quick work," I remarked, and puffed out some smoke. "Have you
  figured out how long it takes even light to reach the earth from that distant
  star, Mr. Croft?"</p>

  <p>"Light?" He half-knit his brows, then suddenly laughed without sound. "Oh,
  I see&mdash;you refer to the equation of time?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes. The distance is considerable, as you must admit."</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "How long does it take you to think of Palos&mdash; of
  Sirius?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not long," I replied.</p>

  <p>He leaned back in his seat. "Murray," he went on, staring straight before
  him, "time is but the measure of consciousness. Outside the atmospheric
  envelopes of the planets&mdash;outside the limit of,
  well&mdash;say&mdash;human thought&mdash;time ceases to exist. And&mdash;if
  between the planets there is no time beyond the depths of their
  surrounding-atmosphere&mdash;how long will it take to go from here to
  there?"</p>

  <p>I stared. His statement was startling, at least.</p>

  <p>"You mean that time is a mental conception?" I managed at last.</p>

  <p>"Time is a mental measure of a span of eternity," he said slowly. "Past
  planetary atmospheres, eternity alone exists. In eternity there is no time.
  Hence, I cannot use what is not, either in going to or returning from that
  planet I have named. You admit you can think instantly of Palos. I allege
  that I can think myself, carry my astral consciousness instantly to Palos. Do
  you see?"</p>

  <p>I saw what he meant, of course, and I indicated as much by a nod.</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "you told me you had to return to Palos. Now you tell
  me you had projected your astral body to that star. What could you do there
  in the astral state?"</p>

  <p>He smiled. "Very little. I know. I have passed through that stage. As a
  matter of fact, I have a body there now."</p>

  <p>"You have what&mdash;" As I remember, I came half out of my chair, and
  then sank back. The thing hit me as nothing else in my whole life had done
  before. His calm avowal was unbelievable on its face&mdash;
  impossible&mdash;a man with a double corporeal existence on two separate
  planets at one and the same time.</p>

  <p>"A body&mdash;a living, breathing body," he repeated his declaration. "Oh,
  man, I know it overthrows all human conceptions of life, but&mdash;last night
  you asked me a question concerning this body of mine&mdash;and I told you I
  knew what I was doing. And I know you must have studied some of the teachings
  of the higher cult&mdash;the esoteric philosophies, if you will. And
  therefore you must have read of the ability of a spirit to dispossess a body
  of its original spiritual tenant and occupy its place&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Obsession," I interrupted. "You are practicing that&mdash;up there?"</p>

  <p>"No. I've gone farther than that. I took this body when its original
  occupant was done with it," he said. "Murray&mdash;wait&mdash;let me explain.
  I'm a physician like yourself."</p>

  <p>"You?" I exclaimed, none too politely, I fear, in the face of this
  additional surprise.</p>

  <p>Croft's lips twitched. He seemed to understand and yet be slightly
  amused.</p>

  <p>"Yes. That's why I was able to assure you I knew how long the body I
  occupy now could endure a cataleptic condition last night. I am a graduate of
  Rush, and I fancy, fully qualified to speak concerning the body's needs.
  And&mdash;" He paused a moment, then resumed: "Frankly, Murray, I find myself
  confronted by what I think I may call the strangest position a man was ever
  called, upon to face. Last night I recognized in you one who had probably far
  from a minor understanding of mental and spiritual forces. Your ability to
  force my return at a time when I was otherwise engaged showed me your
  understanding. For that very reason I asked you to, return to me here to-day.
  I would like to talk to you&mdash;a brother physician; to tell you a
  story&mdash;my story, provided you would care to hear it. Most men would call
  me insane. Something tells me you, who devote your time to the care of the
  insane, will not."</p>

  <p>He paused and sat once more staring across the sunlit landscape which,
  after the storm of the night before, was glowing and fresh. After a time he
  turned his eyes and looked into mine with something almost an appeal, in his
  glance. In response, I nodded and settled myself in my chair.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to deny a natural curiosity. Dr. Croft," I said, since, to
  tell the absolute truth, I was anxious to get at the inward facts underlying
  the entire peculiar affair.</p>

  <p>"Then," he said in an almost eager fashion, "I shall tell you&mdash; the
  whole thing, I think. Murray, when Shakespeare wrote into one of his
  character's mouth the statement that there are more things in heaven and
  earth than are dreamt of, he told the truth. Mankind in the main is like a
  crowd storming the doors of a show-house sold out to capacity and unable to
  accommodate anyone else. Mankind is the crowd in the lobby, shut out from the
  real sights back of the veiling doors which bar their perception of what goes
  on within. Mankind stands only on the fringe of life, does not dream of the
  truth. Only here and there is there one who knows. It was one such who first
  directed my mind toward the truth.</p>

  <p>"Murray"&mdash;he paused and once more fastened me with his gaze&mdash;"I
  am going to tell that truth to you... But first&mdash;in order that you may
  understand, and believe if you can, I shall tell you something of
  myself."</p>

  <p>That telling took a long time&mdash;hours, the rest of the afternoon, and
  most of the following night. It was a strange tale, an unbelievably strange
  story. And yet, in view of what happened inside that same week, I am not
  sure, after all, but it was the truth, just as Croft alleged. What, when all
  is said, do any of us know beyond the round of our own human life? What do we
  know of those things which may lie outside the scope of our mental vision?
  There must be things in heaven and earth not dreamt of in the philosophy of
  Horatio. Here is the tale.</p>

  <p>Jason Croft was born in New Jersey, but brought West at an early age by
  his parents, who had become converts to a certain faith. Right there, it
  seems to me, may have been laid the foundation of Croft's interest in the
  occult in later life, since that faith contains possibly a greater number of
  parallels to occult teachings than any of the Occidental creeds. Of course,
  in all religions there is the germ of truth. Were it not, they would be dead
  dogmas rather than living sects. But in this church, which has grown strong
  in the Western States, I think there is a closer approach to the Eastern
  theory of soul and spiritual life.</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, Croft grew to manhood in the very State and town where
  I was now employed, and in the home on the porch of which we sat. He elected
  medicine as a career. He went to Chicago and put in his first three years.
  The second year his mother died, and-a year later his father. He returned on
  each occasion, and went back to his studies after the obsequies were done. In
  his fourth year he met a man named Gatua Kahaun, destined, as it seems, to
  change the entire course of his life.</p>

  <p>Gatua Kahaun was a Hindu, a member of an Eastern brotherhood, come to the
  United States to study the religions of the West. One can see how naturally
  he took up with Croft, who had been raised in one of those religions. The two
  became friends. From what Croft told me, the Hindu was a man of marked
  attainments, well versed in the Oriental creeds. When Croft came West after
  his graduation, Gatua Kahaun was his companion and stopped at his home, which
  had been kept up by Mrs. Goss and her husband, then still alive. The two
  lived there together for some weeks, and the Hindu taught Croft the rudiments
  at least of the occult philosophy of life.</p>

  <p>Then, with little warning. Croft was assigned on a mission to Australia by
  his church. He got a letter from "Box B," as he told me, smiling, knowing I
  would understand. The church of which he was a member has a custom of sending
  their members about the world as missionaries of their faith, to spread its
  doctrines and win converts to their ranks. Croft went, though even then he
  had begun to see the similarity between his own lifelong creed and the scheme
  of things held before him by Gatua Kahaun.</p>

  <p>For over two years he did not see the Hindu, though he kept up his studies
  of the occult, to which he seemed inclined by a natural bent. Then, just as
  he was nearly finished with his "mission," what should happen but that,
  walking the streets of Melbourne, he bumped into Gatua Kahaun.</p>

  <p>The two men renewed their acquaintance at once. Gatua Kahaun taught Croft
  Hindustani and the mysteries of the Sanskrit tongue. When Croft's mission was
  finished he prevailed upon him to visit India before returning home.</p>

  <p>Croft went. Through Gatua's influence he was admitted to the man's own
  brotherhood. He forgot his former objects and aims in life in the new world
  of thought which opened up before his mental eyes. He studied and thought. He
  learned the secrets of the magnetic or enveloping body of the soul, and after
  a time he became convinced that by constant application to the major purpose
  the spirit could break the bonds of the material body without going through
  the change which men call death. He came to believe that beyond the
  phenomenon of astral projection&mdash;the sending of the conscious ego about
  the earthly sphere&mdash; projections might be made beyond the planet, with
  only the universe to limit the scope of the flight.</p>

  <p>At times he lay staring at the starry vault of the heavens with a vague
  longing within him to put the thing to the test. And always there was one
  star which seemed to call him, to beckon to him, to draw his spirit toward it
  as a magnet may draw a fleck of iron. That was the Dog Star, Sirius, known to
  astronomers as the sun of another planetary system like our own.</p>

  <p>Meantime his studies went on. He learned that matter is the reflex of
  spirit; that no blade of grass, no chemical atom exists save as the envelope
  of an essence which cannot and does not die. He came to see that nature is no
  more than a realm of force, comprising light, heat, magnetism, chemical
  affinity, aura, essence, and all the imponderables which go to produce the
  various forms of motion as expressions of the ocean of force, so that motion
  comes to be no more than force refracted through the various forms of
  existence, from the lowest to the highest, as a ray of light is split into
  the seven primary colors by a prism, each being different in itself, yet each
  but an integral part of the original ray.</p>

  <p>He came to comprehend that all stages of existence are but stages and
  nothing more, and that mind, spirit, is the highest form of life
  force&mdash;the true essence&mdash;manifesting through material means, yet
  independent of them in itself. So only, he argued, was life after death a
  possible thing. And so, he reasoned further, could the mystery be solved,
  there was no real reason why the spirit could not be set free to roam and
  return to the body at will. If that were true, it seemed to him that the
  spirit could return from such excursions, bringing with it a conscious
  recollection of the place where it had been.</p>

  <p>Then once more he was called home by a thing which seems like no more than
  a further step in the course of what mortals call fate. His father's brother
  died. He was a bachelor. He left Croft sufficient wealth to provide for his
  every need. Croft decided to pursue his studies at home. He had gained all
  India could give him. Indeed, he had rather startled even Gatua Kahaun by
  some of the theories he had deduced.</p>

  <p>He began work at once. He stocked the library where I had found him the
  night before with everything on the subject he could find. And the more he
  studied, the more firmly did he become convinced that ordinary astral
  projection was but the first step in developing the spirit's power&mdash;that
  it was akin to the first step of an infant learning to walk, and that, if
  confidence were forthcoming, if the will to dare the experiment were
  sufficiently strong&mdash;then he could accomplish the thing of which he
  dreamed.</p>

  <p>He began to experiment, sending his astral consciousness here and there.
  He centered on that one phase of his knowledge alone. He roamed the earth at
  will. He perfected his ability to bring back from such excursions a vivid
  recollection of all he had seen. So at last he was ready for the great
  experiment. Yet in the end he made it on impulse rather than at any
  preselected time.</p>

  <p>He sat one evening on his porch. Over the eastern mountains which hem in
  the valley the full moon was rising in a blaze of mellow glory. Its rays
  caught the sleeping surface of a lake which lies near our little city,
  touching each rippling wavelet until they seemed made of molten silver. The
  lights of the town itself were like fireflies twinkling amid the trees. The
  mountains, hazed somewhat in a silvery mist compounded of the moon-rays and
  distance, seemed to him no more than the figments of a fairy-tale or a
  dream.</p>

  <p>Everything was quiet. Mrs. Goss, now a widow, had gone to bed, and Croft
  had simply been enjoying the soft air and a cigar. Suddenly, as the moon
  appeared to leap free of the mountains, it suggested a thought of a spirit
  set free and rising above the material shell of existence to his mind.</p>

  <p>He sat watching the golden wheel radiant with reflected light, and after a
  time he asked himself why he should not try the great adventure without a
  longer delay. He was the last of his race. No one depended upon him. Should
  he fail, they would merely find his body in the chair. Should he succeed, he
  would have won his ambition and placed himself in a position to learn of
  things which had heretofore baffled man.</p>

  <p>He decided to try it there and then. Knocking the ash from his cigar, he
  took one last, long, possibly farewell whiff, and laid it down on the broad
  arm of his chair. Then, summoning all the potent power of his will, he fixed
  his whole mind upon his purpose and sank into cataleptic sleep.</p>

  <p>The moon is dead. In so much science is right. It is lifeless, without
  moisture, without an atmosphere. Croft won his great experiment, or its first
  step at least. His body sank to sleep, but his ego leaped into a fuller,
  wider life.</p>

  <p>There was a sensation of airy lightness, as though his sublimated
  consciousness had dropped material weight. His body sat beneath him in the
  chair. He could see it. He could see the city and the lake and the mountains
  and the yellow disk of the moon. He knew he was rising toward the latter
  swiftly. Then&mdash;space was annihilated in an instant, and he seemed to
  himself to be standing on the topmost edge of a mighty crater in the full,
  unobstructed glare of a blinding light. He sensed that as the sun, which hung
  like a ball of fire halfway up from the horizon, flinging its rays in a
  dazzling brilliance against the dead satellite's surface, unprotected by an
  atmospheric screen. His first sensation was an amazing realization of his own
  success. Then he gazed about.</p>

  <p>To one side was the vast ring of the crater itself, a well of unutterable
  darkness and unplumbed depth, as yet not opened up to the burning light of
  the sun. To the other was the downward sweep of the crater's flank, dun,
  dead, wrinkled, seamed and seared by the stabbing rays which bathed it in
  pitiless light. And beyond the foot of the crater was a vast irregular plain,
  lower in the center as though eons past it might have been the bed of some
  vanished sea. About the plain were the crests of barren mountains, crags,
  pinnacles, misshapen and weird beyond thought.</p>

  <p>Yes, the moon is dead&mdash;now. But&mdash;there was life upon it once.
  Croft willed himself down from the lip of the crater to the plain. He moved
  about it. Indeed it had been a sea. There in the airless blaze, still etched
  in the lifeless formations, he found an ancient water-line, the mark of the
  fingers of vanished waters&mdash;like a mockery of what had been. And
  skirting the outline of that long-lost sea, he came to the ruin of a city
  which had stood upon the shores a myriad years ago. It stood there
  still&mdash;a thing of paved streets, and dead walls, safe in that
  moistureless world from decay.</p>

  <p>Through those dead streets and houses, some of them thrown down by
  terrific earthquakes which he judged had accompanied the final cooling stages
  and death of the moon, Croft took his way, pausing now and then to examine
  some ancient inscriptions cut into the blocks of stone from which the
  buildings had been reared. In a way they impressed him as similar in many
  respects to the Asiatic structures of to-day, most of them being windowless
  on the first story, but built about an inner court, gardens of beauty in the
  time when the moon supported life.</p>

  <p>So far as he could judge from the buildings themselves and frescoes on the
  walls, done in pigments which still prevailed, the lunarians had been a tiny
  people, probably not above an average of four feet in height, but extremely
  intelligent past any doubt, as shown by the remains of their homes. They had
  possessed rather large heads in proportion to their slender bodies, as the
  paintings done on the inside walls led Croft to believe.</p>

  <p>From the same source he became convinced that their social life had been
  highly developed, and that they had been well versed in the arts of
  manufacture and commerce, and had at the time when lunar seas persisted
  maintained a merchant marine.</p>

  <p>Through the hours of the lunar day he explored. Not, in fact, until the
  sun was dropping swiftly below the rim of the mountains beyond the old
  sea-bed, did he desist. Then, lifting his eyes, he beheld a luminous
  crescent, many times larger than the moon appears to us, emitting a soft,
  green light. He stood and gazed upon it for some moments before he realized
  fully that he looked upon a sunrise on the earth&mdash;that the monster
  crescent was the earth indeed as seen from her satellite.</p>

  <p>Then, as realization came upon him, he remembered his body&mdash;left on
  the porch of his home in the chair. Suddenly he felt a longing to return, to
  forsake the forsaken relics of a life which had passed and go back to the
  full, pulsing tide of life which still flowed on.</p>

  <p>Here, then, he was faced by the second step of his experiment. He had
  consciously reached the moon. Could he return again to the earth? If so, he
  had proved his theory beyond any further doubt. Fastening his full power upon
  the endeavor, he willed himself back, and&mdash;</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes&mdash;his physical eyes&mdash;and gazed into the early
  sun of a new day rising over the mountains and turning the world to emerald
  and gold. The sound of a caught-in breath fell on his ears. He turned his
  glance. Mrs. Goss stood beside him.</p>

  <p>"Laws, sir, but you was sound asleep!" she exclaimed. "I come to call you
  to breakfast an' you wasn't in your room, an' when I found you you was
  sleepin' like th' dead. You must have got up awful early, Mr. Jason."</p>

  <p>"I was here before you were moving," Croft said as he rose. He smiled as
  he spoke. Indeed, he wanted to laugh, to shout. He had done what no mortal
  had ever accomplished before. The wonders of the universe were his to explore
  at will. Yet even so he did not dream of what the future held.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">III. &mdash; BEYOND THE MOON</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AND now the Dog Star called. Croft had proved his ability to
  project his conscious self beyond earth's attraction and return. And, having
  proved that, the old lure of the star he had watched when a student in the
  Indian mountains came back with a double strength. No longer was it an
  occasional prompting. Rather it was a never-ceasing urge which nagged him
  night and day.</p>

  <p>He yielded at last. But remembering his return from his first experiment,
  he arranged for the next with due care. In order that Mrs. Goss might not
  become alarmed by seeing his body entranced, he arranged for her to take a
  holiday with a married daughter in another part of the State, telling her
  simply that he himself expected to be absent from his home for an indefinite
  time and would summon her upon his return.</p>

  <p>He knew the woman well enough to be sure she would spread the word of his
  coming absence, and so felt assured that his body would remain undisturbed
  during the period of his venture into universal space.</p>

  <p>Having seen the old woman depart, he entered the library, drew down all
  the blinds, and stretched himself on the couch. Fixing his mind on Sirius to
  the exclusion of everything else, he threw off the bonds of the flesh.</p>

  <p>Yet here, as it chanced, even Croft made a well-nigh fatal mistake. It was
  toward Sirius he had willed himself in his thoughts, and Sirius is a sun. As
  a result, he realized none too soon that he was floating in the actual nebula
  surrounding the flaming orb itself. Directly beneath him, as it appeared, the
  Dog Star rolled, a mass of electric fire. Mountains of flame ran darting off
  into space in all directions. Between them the whole surface of the sun
  boiled and bubbled and seethed like a world- wide caldron. Not for a moment
  was there any rest upon that surface toward which he was sinking with
  incredible speed. Every atom of the monster sun was in motion, ever-shifting,
  ever- changing, yet always the same. It quivered and billowed and shook.
  Flames of every conceivable color radiated from it in waves of awful heat.
  Vast explosions recurred again and again on the ever-heaving surface. What
  seemed unthinkable hurricanes rushed into the voids created by the exploding
  gases.</p>

  <p>In this maelstrom of titanic forces Croft found himself caught. Not even
  the wonderful force his spirit had attained could overcome the sun's power of
  repulsion. His progress stayed, he hung above the molten globe beneath him,
  imprisoned, unable to extricate him-self from his position, buffeted, swirled
  about and swayed by the irresistible forces which warred around him in a
  never-ceasing tumult such as he had never conceived.</p>

  <p>Something like a vague question as to his fate rather than any fear
  assailed him, something like a blind wonder. The force which held him was one
  beyond his experience or knowledge. He knew that a true spirit, a pure ego,
  could not wholly perish, yet now he asked himself what would be the effect of
  close proximity to such an enormous center of elemental activity upon an ego
  not wholly sublimated, such as his.</p>

  <p>His will power actually faltered, staggered. For the time being he lost
  his ability to chose his course. He had willed himself here, and here he was,
  but he found himself unable to will himself back or anywhere else, in fact.
  The sensation crept through his soul that he was a plaything of fate, a mad
  ego which had ventured too far, dared too much, sought to learn those things
  possibly forbidden, hence caught in a net of universal law, woven about him
  by his own mad thirst for knowledge&mdash;a spirit doomed by its own daring
  to an eternity of something closely approaching the orthodox hell.</p>

  <p>Through eons of time, as it seemed to him, he hung above that blazing orb,
  surrounded by seething gases which dimmed but did not wholly obscure his
  vision. Then a change began taking place. A great spot of darkness appeared
  on the pulsing body of the sun. It widened swiftly. About it the fiery
  elements of molten mass seemed to center their main endeavor. Vast streamers
  of flaming gas leaped and darted about its spreading center. It stretched and
  spread.</p>

  <p>To Croft's fascinated vision it showed a mighty, funnel-like chasm,
  reaching down for thousands of miles into the very heart of their solar mass.
  And suddenly he knew that once more he was sinking, was being drawn down,
  down, to be engulfed in that terrible throat of the terrifying funnel, swept
  and sucked down like a bit of driftwood into the maw of a whirlpool,
  powerless to resist.</p>

  <p>Down he sank, down, between walls of living fire which swirled about him
  with an inconceivable velocity of revolution. The vapors which closed about
  him seemed to stifle even his spirit senses. Down, down, how far he had no
  conception. He had lost all control, all conscious power to judge of time or
  distance. Yet he was able still to see. And so at last he sensed that the
  fiery walls were coming swiftly together.</p>

  <p>For a wild instant he conceived himself engulfed. Then he knew that he was
  being thrown out and upward again with terrific force, literally crowded
  forth with the outrushing gases between the collapsing walls, and hurled
  again into space.</p>

  <p>Darkness came down, a darkness so deep it seemed a thousand suns might not
  pierce it through with their rays. Sirius, the great sun, seemed blotted out.
  He was seized by a sense of falling through that Stygian shroud. In which
  direction he knew not, or why or how. He knew only that his ego over which he
  had lost control was swirling in vast spirals down and down through an
  endless void to an endless fate&mdash;that he who had come so confidently
  forth to explore the universal secrets had become a waif in the uncharted
  immensity of the eternal universe.</p>

  <p>The sensation went on and on. So much he knew. Still he was conscious. The
  thought came to him that this was his punishment for daring to know. Still
  conscious, he must be still bound by natural law. Had he broken that law and
  been cast into utter darkness, to remain forever conscious of his fate? Yet
  if so, where was he falling, where was he to wander, and for how long? His
  senses reeled.</p>

  <p>By degrees, however, he fought back to some measure of control. His very
  necessity prompted the attempt. And by degrees there came to him a sense of
  not being any longer alone. In the almost palpable darkness it seemed that
  other shapes and forms, whose warp and woof was darkness also, floated and
  writhed about him as he fell.</p>

  <p>They thrust against him; they gibbered soundlessly at him. They taunted
  him as he passed. And yet their very presence helped him in the end. He
  called his own knowledge to his assistance. He recognized these shapes of
  terror as those elementals of which occult teaching spoke, things which
  roamed in the darkness, which had as yet never been able to reach out and
  gain a soul for themselves.</p>

  <p>With understanding came again the power of independent action. Unknowing
  whither, Croft willed himself out of their midst to some spot unnamed, where
  he might gain a spiritual moment of rest&mdash;to the nearest bit of matter
  afloat in the universal void. Abruptly he became aware of the near presence
  of some solid substance, the sense of falling ended, and he knew that his
  will had found expression in fact.</p>

  <p>Yet wherever it was he had landed, the region was dead. Like the moon, it
  was wholly devoid of moisture or atmosphere. The presence of solid matter,
  however, gave him back a still further sense of control. Though he was still
  enveloped in darkness, he reasoned that if this was a planet and possessed of
  a sun in its system, its farther side must be bathed in light. Reason also
  told him that in all probability he was still within the system of Sirius
  despite the seemingly endless distance he had come.</p>

  <p>Exerting his will, he passed over the darkened face and emerged on the
  other side in the midst of a ghostly light. At once he became conscious of
  his surroundings, of a valley and encircling lofty mountains. Prom the sides
  of the latter came the peculiar light. Examination showed Croft that it was
  given off by some substance which glowed with a phosphorescence sufficient to
  cast faint shadows of the rocks which strewed the dead and silent waste.</p>

  <p>Not knowing where he was, loath to dare again the void, hardly knowing
  whether to will himself back to earth or remain and abide the issue of his
  own adventure, Croft waited, debating the question, until at length the top
  of a mountain lighted as if from a rising sun. Inside a few moments the
  valley was bathed in light; he saw the great sun Sirius wheel up the morning
  sky.</p>

  <p>Peace came into his soul. He was still a conscious ego, still a creature
  in the universe of light. He gazed about. Close to the line of the horizon,
  and shining with what was plainly reflected light, he saw the vast outlines
  of another planet he had failed to note until now.</p>

  <p>He understood. This was the major planet, surely one of the Dog Star's
  pack; and he had alighted on one of its moons. All desire to remain there
  left him. He was tired of dead worlds, of bottomless voids.</p>

  <p>As before on the moon itself, he felt a resurgent desire to bathe in an
  atmosphere of life. By now, fairly himself again, the wish was father to the
  fact. Summoning his will, he made the final step of his journey, as it was to
  prove, and found himself standing on a world not so vastly different from his
  own.</p>

  <p>He stood on the side of a mountain in the midst of an almost tropic
  vegetation. Giant trees were about him, giant ferns sprouted from the soil.
  But here, as on earth, the color of the leaves was green. Through a break in
  the forest he gazed across a vast, wide-flung plain through which a mighty
  river made its way. Its waters glinted in the rays of the rising sun. Its
  banks were lined with patches of what he knew from their appearance were
  cultivated fields. Beyond them was a dun track, reminding him of the arid
  stretches of a desert, reaching out as far as his vision could plumb the
  distance.</p>

  <p>He turned his eyes and followed the course of the river. By stages of
  swift interest he traced it to a point where it disappeared beneath what
  seemed the dull red walls of a mighty city. They were huge walls, high and
  broad, bastioned and towered, flung across the course of the river, which ran
  on through the city itself, passed beyond a farther wall, and&mdash; beyond
  that again there was the glint of silver and blue in Croft's eyes&mdash;the
  shimmer of a vast body of water&mdash;whether lake or ocean he die not know
  then.</p>

  <p>The call of a bird brought his attention back. Life was waking in the
  mountain forest where he stood. Gay-plumaged creatures, not unlike earthly
  parrots, were fluttering from tree to tree.</p>

  <p>The sound of a grunting came toward him. He swung about. His eyes
  encountered those of other life. A creature such as he had never seen was
  coming out of a quivering mass of sturdy fern. It had small, beady eyes and a
  snout like a pig. Two tusks sprouted from its jaws like the tusks of a boar.
  But the rest of the body, although something like that of a hog, was covered
  with a long wool-like hair, fine and seemingly almost silken soft.</p>

  <p>This, as he was to learn later, was the tabur, an animal still wild on
  Palos, though domesticated and raised both for its hair, which was woven into
  fabrics, and for its flesh, which was valued as food. While Croft watched, it
  began rooting about the foot of a tree on one side of the small glade where
  he stood. Plainly it was hunting for something to eat.</p>

  <p>Once more he turned to the plain and stood lost in something new. Across
  the dun reaches of the desert, beyond the green region of the river, was
  moving a long dark string of figures, headed toward the city he had seen. It
  was like a caravan, Croft thought, in its arrangement, save that the moving
  objects which he deemed animals of some sort, belonged in no picture of a
  caravan such as he had ever seen.</p>

  <p>Swiftly he willed himself toward them and moved along by their side.
  Something like amazement filled his being. These beasts were such creatures
  as might have peopled the earth in the Silurian age. They were huge, twice
  the size of an earthly elephant. They moved in a majestic fashion, yet with a
  surprising speed. Their bodies were covered with a hairless skin, reddish-
  pink in color, wrinkled and warted and plainly extremely thick. It slipped
  and slid over the muscles beneath it as they swung forward on their four
  massive legs, each one of which ended in a five-toed foot armed with short,
  heavy claws.</p><a id="pic1"
        name="pic1"></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0801081h-images/Palos-1.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>But it was the head and neck and tail of the things which gave Croft
  pause. The head was more that of a sea-serpent or a monster lizard than
  anything else. The neck was long and flexible and curved like that of a
  camel. The tail was heavy where It joined the main spine, but thinned rapidly
  to a point. And the crest of head and neck, the back of each creature, so far
  as he could see, was covered with a sort of heavy scale, an armor devised by
  nature for the thing's protection, as it appeared. Yet he could not see very
  well, since each sarpelca, as he was to learn their Palosian name, was,
  loaded heavily with bundles and bales of what might be valuable
  merchandise.</p>

  <p>And on each sat a man. Croft hesitated not at all to give them that title,
  since they were strikingly like the men of earth in so far as he could see.
  They had heads and arms and legs and a body, and their faces were white.
  Their features departed in no particular, so far as he could see,-from the
  faces of earth, save that all were smooth, with no evidence of hair on upper
  lip, or cheek or chin.</p>

  <p>They were clad in loose cloak-like garments and a hooded cap or cowl. They
  sat the sarpelcas just back of the juncture of the body and neck, and guided
  the strange-appearing monsters by means of slender reins affixed to two of
  the fleshy tentacles which sprouted about the beast's almost snakelike
  mouths.</p>

  <p>That this strange cortge was a caravan Croft was now assured. He decided
  to follow it to the city and inspect that as well. Wherefore he kept on
  beside it down the valley, along what he now saw was a well-defined and
  carefully-constructed road, built of stone, cut to a nice approximation,
  along which the unwieldy procession made good time. The road showed no small
  knowledge of engineering. It was like the roads of Ancient Rome, Croft
  thought with quickened interest. It was in a perfect state of preservation
  and showed signs of recent mending here and there. While he was feeling a
  quickened interest in this the caravan entered the cultivated region along
  the river, and Croft gave his attention to the fields.</p>

  <p>The first thing he noted here was the fact that all growth was due to
  irrigation, carried out by means of ditches and laterals very much as on
  earth at the present time. Here and there as the caravan passed down the
  splendid road he found a farmer's hut set in a bower of trees. For the most
  part they were built of a tan- colored brick, and roofed with a thatching of
  rushes from the river's bank. He saw the natives working in the fields,
  strong- bodied men, clad in what seemed a single short-skirted tunic
  reaching, to the knees, with the arms and lower limbs left bare.</p>

  <p>One or two stopped work and stood to watch the caravan pass, and Croft
  noticed that their faces were intelligent, well-featured, and their hair for
  the most part a sort of rich, almost chestnut brown, worn rather long and
  wholly uncovered or else caught about the brows by a cincture which held a
  bit of woven fabric draped over the head and down the neck.</p>

  <p>Travel began to thicken along the road. The natives seemed heading to the
  city, to sell the produce of their fields. Croft found himself drawing aside
  in the press as the caravan overtook the others and crowded past. So real had
  it become to him that for the time he forgot he was no more than an
  impalpable, invisible thing these people could not contact or see. Then he
  remembered and gave his attention to what he might behold once more.</p>

  <p>They had just passed a heavy cart drawn by two odd creatures, resembling a
  deer save that they were larger and possessed of hoofs like those of
  earth-born horses, and instead of antlers sported two little horns not over
  six inches long. They were in color almost a creamy white, and he fancied
  them among the most beautiful forms of animal life he had ever beheld. On the
  cart itself were high-piled crates of some unknown fowl, as he
  supposed&mdash;some edible bird, with the head of a goose, the plumage of a
  pheasant so far as its brilliant coloring went, a long neck and bluish,
  webbed feet. Past the cart they came upon a band of native women carrying
  baskets and other burdens, strapped to their shoulders. Croft gave them
  particular attention, since as yet he had seen only men.</p>

  <p>The Palosian females were fit mates, he decided, after he had given them a
  comprehensive glance. They were strong-limbed and deep-breasted. These
  peasant folks at least were simply clad. Like the men, they wore but a single
  garment, falling just over the bend of the knees and caught together over one
  shoulder with an embossed metal button, so far as he could tell. The other
  arm and shoulder were left wholly bare, as were their feet and legs, save
  that they wore coarse sandals of wood, strapped by leather thongs about ankle
  and calf. Their baskets were piled with vegetables and fruit, and they
  chattered and laughed among themselves as they walked.</p>

  <p>And now, as the sarpelcas shuffled past, the highway grew actually packed.
  Also it drew nearer to the river and the city itself. The caravan thrust its
  way through a drove of the taburs&mdash;the woolly hogs such as Croft had
  seen on the side of the mountain. The hogsherds, rough, powerful, bronzed
  fellows, clad in hide aprons belted about their waists and nothing else,
  stalked beside their charges and exchanged heavy banter with the riders of
  the sarpelcas as the caravan passed.</p>

  <p>From behind a sound of shouting reached Croft's ears. He glanced around.
  Down the highway, splitting the throng of early market people, came some sort
  of conveyance, drawn by four of the beautiful creamy deer-like creatures he
  had seen before. They were harnessed abreast and had nodding plumes fixed to
  the head- bands of their bridles in front of their horns. These plumes were
  all of a purple color, and from the way the crowds gave way before the
  advance of the equipage. Croft deemed that it bore someone of note. Even the
  captain of the sarpelca train, noting the advance of the gorgeous team, drew
  his huge beasts to the side of the road and stood up in his seat-like saddle
  to face inward as it passed.</p>

  <p>The vehicle came on. Croft watched intently as it approached. So nearly as
  he could tell, it was a four-wheeled conveyance something like an old-time
  chariot in front, where stood the driver of the cream-white steeds, and
  behind that protected from the sun by an arched cover draped on each side
  with a substance not unlike heavy silk. These draperies, too, were purple in
  shade, and the body and wheels of the carriage seemed fashioned from
  something like burnished copper, as it glistened brightly in advance.</p>

  <p>Then it was upon them, and Croft could look squarely into the shaded
  depths beneath the cover he now saw to be supported by upright metal rods,
  save at the back where the body continued straight up in a curve to form the
  top.</p>

  <p>The curtains were drawn back, since the morning air was still fresh, and
  Jason gained a view of those who rode. He gave them one glance and mentally
  caught his breath. There were two passengers in the coach&mdash;a woman and a
  man. The latter was plainly past middle age, well built, with a strongly-set
  face and hair somewhat sprinkled with gray. He was clad in a tunic the like
  of which Croft had never seen, since it seemed woven of gold, etched and
  embroidered in what appeared stones or jewels of purple, red, and green. This
  covered his entire body and ended in half-sleeves below which his forearms
  were bare.</p>

  <p>He wore a jeweled cap supporting a single spray of purple feathers. From
  an inch below his knees his legs were incased in what seemed an open-meshed
  casing of metal, in color not unlike his tunic, jointed at the ankles to
  allow of motion when he walked. There were no seats proper in the carriage,
  but rather a broad padded couch upon which both passengers lay.</p>

  <p>So much Croft saw, and then, forsaking the caravan, let himself drift
  along beside the strange conveyance to inspect the girl. In fact, after the
  first swift glance at the man, he had no eyes save for his companion in the
  coach.</p>

  <p>She was younger than the man, yet strangely like him in a feminine
  way&mdash;more slender, more graceful as she lay at her ease. Her face was a
  perfect oval, framed in a wealth of golden hair, which, save for a jeweled
  cincture, fell unrestrained about her shoulders in a silken flood. Her eyes
  were blue&mdash;the purple blue of the pansy&mdash;her skin, seen on face and
  throat and bared left shoulder and arm, a soft, firm white. For she was
  dressed like the peasant women, save in a richer fashion. Her single robe was
  white, lustrous in its sheen. It was broidered with a simple jeweled margin
  at throat and hem and over the breasts with stones of blue and green.</p>

  <p>Her girdle was of gold in color, catching her just above the hips with
  long ends and fringe which fell down the left side of the knee-length skirt.
  Sandals of the finest imaginable skin were on the soles of her slender
  pink-nailed feet, bare save for a jewel- studded toe and instep band, and the
  lacing cords which were twined about each limb as high as the top of the
  calf. On her left arm she wore a bracelet, just above the wrist, as a single
  ornament.</p>

  <p>Croft gave her one glance which took in every detail of her presence and
  attire. He quivered as with a chill. Some change as cataclysmic as his
  experience of the night before above the Dog Star itself took place in his
  spiritual being. He felt drawn toward this beautiful girl of Palos as he had
  never in all his life on earth been drawn toward a woman before.</p>

  <p>It was as though suddenly he had found something he had lost&mdash;as
  though he had met one known and forgotten and now once more recognized.
  Without giving the act the slightest thought of consideration, he willed
  himself into the coach between the fluttering curtains of purple silk, and
  crouched down on the padded platform at her feet.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV. &mdash; NAIA, PRINCESS OF PALOS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CROFT, in his earth life, had never looked on a woman with
  the longing such as is apt to possess the average healthy male at times. But
  in his studies of the occult he had more than once come in contact with the
  doctrine of twin souls&mdash;that theory that in the beginning the spirit is
  dual, and that projecting into material existence the dual entity separates
  into two halves, a male and a female, and so exists forever until the two
  halves meet once more and unite.</p>

  <p>Sometimes because he had never found a woman to appeal to him as he wished
  a woman to appeal, he had been half inclined to doubt. But this morning on
  Palos he no longer doubted. He believed. More than that he knew now why no
  earth woman had ever reached to the center of his being with her soft
  attraction. He knew now why the Dog Star had always drawn him during his
  student days. That longing to span the miles between Sirius and earth was
  explained. It was because in the economy of the Infinite it had been seen
  fit, God alone knew why, to send his half of their original spirit to earth,
  and his female counterpart to this life on another sphere.</p>

  <p>This beautiful girl was his twin. He knew her. He had found her. A
  wonderful elation filled his conscious soul as he sat feasting his eyes upon
  her every graceful line and feature. But suddenly his contemplation was
  followed by the bitterest despair.</p>

  <p>He had found her, yes; but to what avail? The mere fact that he saw her
  now and was unseen by either her or her father, as he judged the man with
  whom she rode to be, was proof that his finding her was vain. She was a
  living, breathing woman, every cell of whose glowing body sent a subtle call
  to his spirit, such as only the true mate can send to its absolute
  complement.</p>

  <p>He felt love, a sense of protection, a desire for possession, spiritual
  uplift, and physical passion all in a breath. He felt a mad urge to cast
  himself at her side; there on the padded cushion, and gather her lovely form
  to his heart close within his arms. And he knew himself but a
  spirit&mdash;invisible to her&mdash; imperceptible to her&mdash;realized that
  should he follow his impulse she would not know&mdash;or should she know even
  faintly would not understand.</p>

  <p>Croft knew himself but a sublimated shape, and nothing more, and it was
  then he went down into the deepest depths of a mental hell of despair. The
  torture of Tantalus was his. He could see her, sense her youth, her beauty,
  her sweetness, every charm which was hers; experience every potent wave of
  her appeal, yet he could not reveal his presence or make known his response
  to her spirit- call. Could he have done so he would have groaned in a
  crushing anguish too great to be endured. Yet even that expression was
  denied.</p>

  <p>The stopping of the gnuppas, as he was to learn the half horse-, half
  deer-like steers were called, brought him back from his introspection after a
  time. He could hear the driver shouting, and now quite oddly, these people
  being human, and thoughts being more or less akin to all thinking minds, he
  found he could understand the intent, even though the words were strange.</p>

  <p>"Way! Way for Prince Lakkon, Counselor to the King of Aphur!"</p>

  <p>On the words the girl opened her lips.</p>

  <p>"There is a wonderful press of travelers this morning, my father."</p>

  <p>Croft gloried in the soft, full tones of her voice, even before Prince
  Lakkon made answer.</p>

  <p>"Aye, the highway is like to a swarm of insects; Naia, my child."</p>

  <p>Naia! The sound was music in Croft's ears. He whispered it over and over
  to himself as the carriage once more advanced through the throngs of
  market-people, carters, freighters, past a caravan of heavily-loaded
  sarpelcas outward bound.</p>

  <p>Naia. The word fitted her&mdash;seemed oddly appropriate&mdash;was music
  in his ears. Naia, Naia&mdash;the other part of his soul. The word beat upon
  his senses through the shuffle of passing feet.</p>

  <p>"I shall tell Chythron to drive directly to our home," Prince Lakkon
  said.</p>

  <p>"You will go on to confer with Uncle Jadgor from there?"</p>

  <p>"Aye. You will have most of the day to set the servants about the
  preparations for the coming of Prince Kyphallos. Spare no expense, Naia, in
  those preparations. Report hath it he is a hard young man to please."</p>

  <p>"Such reports as I have heard would not confirm yours, my father," Naia
  retorted with a contemptuous curl of her crimson lips. "What has come to my
  ears would prove him no better than a beast, far too easy to please,
  indeed."</p>

  <p>Prince Lakkon shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Child!" he chided in sibilant fashion. "You must not speak such words of
  a Prince of Tamarizia, Naia."</p>

  <p>But the maid replied more calmly: "I speak not of him as a Prince of
  Tamarizia, but as a man and his attitude toward women."</p>

  <p>Croft was rather surprised to see Lakkon frown at his daughter's speech.
  He himself applauded her attitude toward a man he judged must be a profligate
  of national reputation. He set the man's facial grimace down to mere distaste
  for hearing anyone of royal blood disrated, and as the prince made no reply,
  sat waiting what might happen next and watching Naia where she reclined.</p>

  <p>"What brings him to Himyra?" she questioned at length.</p>

  <p>"He comes on matters of state."</p>

  <p>Prince Lakkon's reply was almost rudely sharp and short. As he ended his
  answer he sighed and lifted himself to a cross-legged seat. "Ah, here we are
  at the gate. Naia, there is nothing finer in all Tamarizia than this. No, not
  even in Zitra itself."</p>

  <p>Whether he uttered the exact truth or not Croft did not then know, but as
  he gazed from the coach between the curtains of fluttering purple he was
  inclined to agree. They had come to a place outside the walls&mdash;those
  monster walls Croft had seen hours ago, shining a dull deep red in the
  morning sun. Now close by, they towered above him in their mighty
  mass&mdash;still red&mdash;a deep, ruddy red with an odd effect of a glaze on
  the surface of what he could now perceive was some sort of artificial
  building-block laid in cement. So far as he could judge, the wall rose a good
  hundred feet above the road and stretched away on either side, strengthened
  and guarded every so far by a jutting tower as far as his eye could
  reach.</p>

  <p>Where they now stood the road came down to the bank of the river on a
  wide-built approach made of stone masonry laid in cement, protected on the
  shore-line by a wall or rail, fully six feet wide across its top, which was
  provided every so far with huge stone urns, blackened about their upper edges
  as though from fire. Croft recognized their purpose as that of flaming
  beacons to light the wide stone esplanade before the gate at night.</p>

  <p>Beyond the wall was the river&mdash;a vast yellow flood, moving slowly
  along. It was at least a half-mile wide where it met the wall. And the wall
  crossed it on a series of arches, leaving free way for the boats Croft now
  saw upon the yellow water, equipped with sails and masts, making slow advance
  against the current, or driven perhaps by their crews at long sweep-like
  oars.</p>

  <p>He noted that each arch was guarded by what seemed gates of metal lattice,
  and that drawn up above each was a huge metal door which could be let down in
  case of need to present an unbroken outward front above the surface of the
  flood.</p>

  <p>It was a wonderful sight, river, wall, and wide-paved approach as the
  gnuppas drew the carriage swiftly toward the gates. Then it all vanished.
  Croft caught sight of two men dressed something like ancient Roman soldiers,
  huge, powerful fellows, with metal cuirass, spear and shield, bare-legged
  half up their thighs where a short skirt extended, their shins covered by
  metal greaves, their heads inside metal casques from the top of which
  sprouted a tuft of wine-red plumes. They stood beside the leaves of two huge
  doors, fashioned from copper, as it seemed to Croft, things solidly molded,
  carved, graved, and embossed in an intricate design. These doors were open
  and the carriage darted through, entering a shadowy tunnel in the wall
  itself. It was high, wide, and deep, the latter dimension giving the actual
  width of the wall itself. Croft judged it to be nearly as wide as tall. Then
  it was passed, and he found himself gazing upon such a scene as had never met
  mortal eyes perhaps since the days of Babylon.</p>

  <p>The great river flowed straight before him for a distance so great that
  the farther wall was lost in a shimmering haze of heat. It flowed between
  solid walls of stone, cut and fitted to perfect jointure. From the lowest
  quay the banks sloped back in gentle terraces, green with grass and studded
  with trees and blooming masses of flowers and shrubs.</p>

  <p>Huge stairways and gradually sloping roadways ran from terrace to terrace,
  down the river's course. And back of the terraced banks there stretched off
  and away the splendid piles of house after house, huge, massive, each a
  palace in itself, until beyond them, seemingly halfway down the wonderful
  river gardens, there loomed a structure greater, vaster, more wide-flung than
  any of the rest. In the light of the risen sun it shone an almost blinding
  white. To Croft at that distance it appeared built of an absolutely spotless
  stone.</p>

  <p>As for the other houses, surely as he felt the abodes of the nobles and
  the rich, they were constructed mainly of red sandstone, red granites and
  marbles, although here and there was one which glowed white through the
  surrounding trees, or perhaps a combination of red and white both. Yet, aside
  from the monster structure in the distance, the majority were red. Indeed, he
  was to come to know later that the word Himyra meant red in the literal
  sense; that in the Palosian tongue this was the "red city," just as he was to
  learn also that the name of the mighty river was Na, because of its yellow
  colored flood.</p>

  <p>But this morning he knew none of that as he gazed down the terraced vista,
  bathed in the rays of Sirius, now rapidly mounting the sky.</p>

  <p>And there was much to see. Across from the vast white building, on the
  other side of the river Na, he beheld a pyramid. He could call it nothing
  else in his earthly mind. It, too, was huge, vast&mdash;a monster red pile,
  rising high above all other buildings in the city, until near the top was a
  final terrace or story of blinding white, capped with a finishing band of
  red; the whole thing supporting a pure white structure, pillared and
  porticoed like a temple on its truncated top. Even in the distance it was a
  monster thing. How large he could not tell. Later he was to know it was two
  thousand feet square at the base, and three hundred feet in its rise above
  its foundation, ere the temple of Zitu was reached.</p>

  <p>But then it struck him merely as vast. Indeed, the whole vista so
  impressed him, with its palaces, its mighty river, its terraces and parks,
  and the great white structure toward which they Were rapidly dashing along a
  road before the massive dwellings, each surrounded by its own private
  park.</p>

  <p>Far, far ahead he caught the dim outline of the farther city wall. He
  began to feel somewhat like Gulliver in the land of Brobdingnag save that the
  city life which he had seen was little larger than that of its kind on
  earth.</p>

  <p>And now between the great white palace and the pyramid a bridge grew into
  being before his eyes. While he watched span after span swung into place to
  form the whole. Already he had noted a series of masonry pillars in the
  stream, but had not comprehended what they meant. Closer examination was to
  teach him that each supported a metal span, mounted on rollers and worked by
  the tug of the current itself through a series of bucket-like bits of
  apparatus, which dragged the sections open or drew them shut; also that at
  night the sections were opened to permit free passage to boats.</p>

  <p>The things like the terraces and the roads showed a good knowledge of
  engineering as a characteristic of the Palosian peoples. But from the fact
  that the terraces and the river embankment were studded at intervals with
  more of the stone fire- urns. Croft decided that they were unacquainted with
  the use of electricity in any form. Nor did they seem to be possessed of a
  practical knowledge of the various applications of steam.</p>

  <p>None of the boats on the river, of which there were many, some plainly
  pleasure-craft equipped with parti-colored sails and others as plainly
  freight and commercial barges, but were propelled by sail and oar. Nor was
  the traffic of the streets other than by foot, or by equipages drawn by
  gnuppas, such as Prince Lakkon's driver was guiding down the well-paved
  street.</p>

  <p>In fact, the more Croft saw of the city of Himyra, the more did he become
  convinced that civilization on Palos had risen little above the stage which
  had marked the Assyrian and Babylonian states on earth in their day.</p>

  <p>Prince Lakkon spoke now to Chythron a word of direction and turned to his
  daughter again.</p>

  <p>"I shall be with Jadgor the greater part of the day. You, Naia, as head of
  my household, must see to these preparations, since as counselor to the king
  I must show a noble from Cathur what courtesy I may, in an official capacity
  at least. Aphur and Cathur guard the highway to all outer nations. Those who
  would carry goods must pass through the gate and so up the Na even to the
  region of Mazzer. Cathur is a mighty state."'</p>

  <p>"As is Aphur, which holds the mouth of the Na," the girl returned.</p>

  <p>"Aye. Together with Nodur, whose interests are Aphur's interests, the
  three could place your Uncle Jadgor on the imperial throne when the term of
  the Emperor Tamhys shall expire."</p>

  <p>Croft pricked his ears, even as he saw a quickened interest wake in Naia's
  face. Plainly Lakkon spoke of various states of the country, and it was
  evident that the girl understood the full import of her father's words.</p>

  <p>"Only Bithur would be against him," she said.</p>

  <p>"Hardly all of Bithur. It lies too close to the lost state of Mazhur for
  that," Lakkon replied. "There were seven states in the Tamarizian Empire, as
  you know, before the war with the Zollarians took one and gave Zollaria their
  first seaport on the central ocean, through our loss."</p>

  <p>His face darkened as he spoke. "Small good it did them, however, since
  there is still the Na, and our other rivers to which they pay toll, if they
  wish to sail to Mazzer or the other barbarian tribes. And as long as Cathur
  and Aphur guard the gate small good will it do them. Zitemku take them and
  all their spawn!"</p>

  <p>"As long as Cathur holds!" Naia exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Lakkon nodded.</p>

  <p>"Aye. Cathur stands cut off from the rest of Tamarizia, as you know, by
  Mazhur's fall. Jadgor would see to it that Cathur still stands despite that
  fact or Zollaria's plans, if she has them, as some of us fear. Tamhys is a
  man of peace. So am I if I may be and Zitu sends it; yet will I fight for my
  own."</p>

  <p>"And Kyphallos comes in regard to this&mdash;this&mdash;alliance?"</p>

  <p>Prince Lakkon nodded.</p>

  <p>"Aye. List you, Naia. Order Bazka to send runners to the hills to bring
  back snows on the eighth day from this. Kyphallos likes his wines cooled, and
  will drink no other. In our own place I have given orders for all fruits and
  fish and fowls to be made ready at the appointed time. See to it that the
  house is decked for his coming&mdash;that all things are made clean and fit
  for inspection. As for yourself, you must have a new robe. Spare no expense,
  my child, spare no expense."</p>

  <p>Naia's eyes lighted as he paused.</p>

  <p>"I should desire it of gold broidered in purple," she flashed back,
  smiling; "with purple sandals wrought with gold."</p>

  <p>And suddenly as the carriage turned into a broad approach leading from the
  main street to a huge red palace, Lakkon laughingly remarked:</p>

  <p>"Have what you will, so long as it becomes thy beauty. Well are you called
  Naia&mdash;maid of gold."</p>

  <p>The carriage paused before the double leaves of a molded copper door.
  Chythron reached out and, seizing a cord which hung down from an arm at one
  side, tugged sharply upon it to sound a deep- toned gong, which boomed
  faintly within.</p>

  <p>Hardly had the sound died than the two leaves rolled back, sinking into
  sockets in the walls, of the building itself, to reveal a vast interior to
  the eye, and in the immediate foreground the figure of a man who gave Croft a
  start of surprise.</p>

  <p>He was nude as Adam, save for a narrow cord about the loins, supporting a
  broad phallary of purple leather. And he was blue! From his shaven scalp
  which supported a single stiff upstanding tuft of ruddy hair throughout his
  entire superbly supple length he was blue. And the color was natural to his
  skin. At first Jason had thought him painted, until a closer glance had
  proved his mistake. Aside from his surprising complexion he seemed human
  enough, with dark eyes, high molar prominences, and a strongly-bridged nose.
  He was indeed not unlike an American Indian, Croft thought, or perhaps a
  Tartar. He remembered now that in times long past the Tartars had worn scalp
  locks, too.</p>

  <p>The blue man bowed from the hips, straightened, and stood waiting. Lakkon
  sprang from the coach and assisted Naia to alight.</p>

  <p>"Bazka," he spoke in command, "your mistress returns. Give ear to her
  words and do those things she says until I come again."</p>

  <p>He sprang back into the coach, and Chythron swung the equipage about. He
  cried aloud to the gnuppas, and they dashed away, back toward the road along
  the Na.</p>

  <p>Croft found himself standing before the open door of Prince Lakkon's city
  palace with Naia and the strange blue man.</p>

  <p>"Call thy fellow servants," the Palosian princess directed as she passed
  inside and Bazka closed the doors by means of a golden lever affixed to the
  inner wall. "I shall see them here and issue my commands."</p>

  <p>She walked with the grace of limbs unrestrained toward the center of the
  wonderful hall.</p>

  <p>For wonderful it was. At first Croft had thought it paved, in part at
  least, with glass of a faultless grade. But as he passed by Naia's side
  toward the center of the half-room, half-court in which flowers and shrubs
  and even small trees grew in beds between the pavement, he saw it was in
  reality some sort of transparent, colorless crystal, cut and set into an
  intricate design.</p>

  <p>Yet that the Palosians made glass he soon found proof. Casting his eyes
  aloft, he saw the metal framework of an enclosing roof arching the court
  above his head. Plainly it was thrown across the width of the court to
  support shutters made of glass of several colors, some of them in place,
  others removed or laid back to leave the court open to the air.</p>

  <p>The court itself was two stories high, and from either end rose a
  staircase of some substance like a lemon-yellow onyx, save that it seemed
  devoid of any mottling or veins. These stairs mounted to the upper gallery,
  supported above the central grand apartment on a series of pure white
  pillars, between which gleamed the exquisite forms of sculptured figures and
  groups.</p>

  <p>There was also a group done in some stone of a translucent white, at the
  foot of each great stair. One, Croft noted, depicted a man and a woman locked
  in each other's arms. The other showed a winged figure, binding up the broken
  pinion of a bird.</p>

  <p>"Love" and "Mercy," he thought. If this were a sample of the ideal of this
  people, they must be a nation worth while.</p>

  <p>So much he saw, and then Naia seated herself on a chair of a wine-red
  wood, set beside a hedge of some unknown vegetation which enclosed a splendid
  central space of the crystal floor.</p>

  <p>Bazka had disappeared, but now came the sound of voices, and the servants
  appeared, emerging from a passage beneath one of the stairs. There were
  several members of both sexes in the group, and, like Bazka himself, one and
  all wore no more than a purple apron about the thighs. Croft was to learn in
  the end that the Palosians wore clothing more as a protection against the
  elements than for any desire to conceal the form; and with that fact he was
  to find them a highly moral people none the less.</p>

  <p>Now, though their apparel, or lack of it, was something of a shock to his
  sense of conventions, as the men and women of the blue tribe advanced to
  greet their mistress in her chair and listen to those directions she gave, he
  found himself wondering if they were slaves. Indeed he so regarded them until
  he knew more of the planet to which he had come. Then he knew slavery no
  longer existed among the Tamarizians, and that the blue men and women were
  the children of former slaves captured in wars, but now freed, given the
  rights of citizenship and paid by those whom they served!</p>

  <p>In the end Naia turned to one of the women and ordered her to go to a
  cloth-merchant and bid him attend her at once, with fabrics from which to
  choose her gown. That done, she dismissed each to his or her task, rose, and
  moved down the court. Croft followed as she went, mounted one of the yellow
  stairs, and came out on the upper balcony, down which she passed over an
  inlaid floor, beside walls frescoed with what he took to be scenes of
  Palosian history and social life.</p>

  <p>She paused at a door fashioned from the wine-red wood, set it open, and
  entered an apartment plainly her own.</p>

  <p>Its walls were faced with the same yellow stone used in the stairs. Purple
  draperies broke the color here and there. Purple curtains hung beside two
  windows which she set open, turning the casings on hinges, to let in the air.
  In the center of the floor, which was covered with woven rugs and the skins
  of various beasts, was a circular metal basin holding water in a shallow
  pool. On one side was a pedestal of gold supporting a pure white miniature of
  a winged male figure, poised on toes as if about to take flight.</p>

  <p>Beside the pool Naia paused as she turned from opening the window. Her
  figure was reflected from the motionless surface. Croft recognized it as a
  mirror in purpose, similar in all respects to those the ancient Phoenicians
  used. For a time she stood gazing at the image of her figure, then turned
  away to a chest, made of the wine-red wood, heavily bound with burnished
  copper bands.</p>

  <p>Beside the chest, the room held several chairs and stools, and a molded
  copper couch covered with rich draperies.</p>

  <p>Naia rummaged in the chest while Croft watched. She rose and turned with a
  garment in her hands. Gossamer it was, fine, soft, sheer, a cobweb of texture
  as she shook it out. It shimmered with an indefinable play of colors,
  transparent as gauze. She lifted a hand and unfastened the gown she wore from
  the heavy shoulder boss that held it in place.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">V. &mdash; PALOSIAN DIPLOMACY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TAKEN wholly by surprise, Croft caught one glimpse of a
  glowing, pliant figure, cinctured just above the hips by a golden girdle.
  Then, realizing that the maiden believed herself utterly alone, he turned to
  the open window and incontinently fled.</p>

  <p>Light as a thistle-down in his sublimated self he emerged into the full
  Palosian day. Yet he quivered in his soul as with a chill. Naia of Aphur,
  Princess of the Tamarizian nation, was a woman to stir the soul of any man.
  And she was his&mdash;his! The thought blurred his senses as he rushed forth.
  His? A second thought gave him pause. His indeed, yet no more his now than
  always since their dual spirit had projected into the material world and had
  been lost each to the other how many eons ago? His&mdash;found now at last,
  yet unclaimable still! Unclaimable!</p>

  <p>The thought was madness. Croft put it away&mdash;or tried. To distract
  himself he wandered over the city of Himyra stretched red in the Sirian ray.
  And as before he knew it vast. From the river it stretched in its red and
  white collection of walls both ways. He visited each part, finding it poorer
  and poorer as he wandered from the river to the walls until inside them, at
  all parts, save where the main avenue by the river reached the two principal
  gates, he found the poorest classes of the people dwelling in huts of
  yellow-red brick.</p>

  <p>Yet Himyra was a wonderful place. Croft visited the quays along the Na,
  farthest from the gate, where he had entered with Prince Lakkon and his
  daughter hours before. They swarmed with life, were lined with boats, built
  principally of wood, though some were mere skin-covered coracles, more than
  anything else. They lay by the stone loading platforms, taking on or
  discharging the commerce of the Palosian world. Men, white and blue, swarmed
  about them, tugging, sweating, straining at their tasks, speaking a variety
  of tongues.</p>

  <p>From the loading platforms on the lower levels tunnels ran up beneath the
  terraces on the surface to reach the warehouses above where the goods were
  stored. Within them, moving in metal-grooves braced to an equal width by
  cross-bars fixed to the floors, small flat-topped cars were drawn by
  whipcord-muscled creatures like giant dogs.</p>

  <p>Croft followed, one such team to a warehouse and watched the storing of
  the load by a series of blue-skinned porters, under the captaincy of a white
  Aphurian who marked each package and bale with a symbol before it was carried
  away. This captain wore a tunic, metal-work cases on his calves, and sandals
  and a belt, from which depended a short, broad-bladed sword. He had seen his
  counterpart on the quays as well and was satisfied that Himyra had a very
  efficient system of officers of the port.</p>

  <p>From the warehouse he went toward an adjacent section, evidently the
  retail mart of the town. Here were shops of every conceivable nature, open in
  front like those of some Oriental bazaar. At this hour of the day business
  was brisk. More than one Palosian lady had come in a gnuppa-drawn conveyance
  to see and choose her purchases for herself. A steady current of life, motion
  and speech, ran through the section. Blue attendants, male or female, as the
  chance fell out, walked with these matrons of Palos, shielding their heads
  from the sun with parasols woven of feathers, held above them on long
  handles, while they examined, selected, and bought. Porters brought baskets
  of fruit and flowers, bolts of cloth, strings of jewels to the metal-built
  carriages behind returning women, and bowed their patrons away.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the sound of a vast, mellow gong, a series of gongs, like an
  old-time carillon rang out. The bustle of the market stopped. As by one
  accord the people turned toward the vast pyramid beyond the river and stood
  standing, gazing toward it.</p>

  <p>It came over Croft that it was here the great chime had sounded&mdash;
  that this mid-day cessation in the activities of life had something to do
  with the religion of the nation. Driven by his will, he reached the great
  structure where the topmost temple shone, dazzling in the noontime light. He
  found himself on the vast level top of the pyramid itself. Before him was the
  temple supported on a base, its doors reached by a flight of stairs. It was
  pillared with monster monoliths, crowned by huge capitals which supported the
  porticoed roof.</p>

  <p>A sound as of chanting came from within. Croft mounted the stairs and
  passed the doors and paused before the beauty of what he saw.</p>

  <p>The temple was roofed with massive slabs of stone save in the exact
  center, where an opening was left. Through that aperture the light of the
  midday sun was falling to bathe a wonderful figure in its rays.</p>

  <p>The face of the statue was divine&mdash;the face of a man, superbly
  strong, broad-browed, and with purity and strength writ in its every line.
  The head and face were wrought in purest white as were the bared left
  shoulder and arm. Below that the figure was portrayed! as clad in gold, which
  was also the material used in modeling the staff crowned by a loop and
  cross-bar, grasped by the hand of the extended left arm. The man was
  portrayed as seated on a massive throne. Now, as the sun's rays struck full
  upon it, it seemed that the strong face glowed with an inward fire.</p>

  <p>On either side of the statue stood a living man, shaven of head, wearing
  long white robes which extended to his feet. Each held in his hand a
  miniature replica of the stave held by the statue&mdash;a staff crowned by a
  golden cross-bar and loop.</p>

  <p>Croft started. This was the <i>crux ansata</i> of the ancient Egyptians in
  all outward form&mdash;the symbol of life everlasting, of man's immortality.
  And he found it here on Palos on the top of a pyramid.</p>

  <p>The chant he had heard was growing louder. It held a feminine timbre to
  his ears. At the rear of the temple a curtain swept aside seemingly of its
  own volition and a procession appeared. It was formed of young
  girls&mdash;their hair garlanded with flowers, each carrying a flaming
  blossom in her hand. They advanced, singing as they came, to form a kneeling
  circle in front of the monster statue on its throne.</p>

  <p>They were clad in purest white, unadorned from their rosy shoulders to
  their dimpled knees save for a cincture of golden tissue which ran about the
  neck, down between the breasts, back about the body, and around to fasten in
  front like a sash with pendent ends, which hung in a golden fringe to the
  edge of the knee-length skirt.</p>

  <p>And as they advanced and knelt and rose and cast their offering of flowers
  before the glowing statue, they continued to chant the harmony which had
  first reached Croft's ear. In it the word Zitu recurred, again and again.
  Zitu then was the name of the statue the name of the god. He listened
  intently and finally gained the purport of the hymn.</p>

  <p>"Zitu, hail Zitu! Father of all life! Who through thy angels Give life and
  withdraw it, Into our bodies&mdash;out of our bodies; God&mdash; the one
  god&mdash;Accept our praise."</p>

  <p>The chant died and the singers turned back behind the curtain, which swung
  shut as they passed.</p>

  <p>Croft left the temple and stood on the top of its broad approach, gazing
  across the river at the vast white structure which he had first seen at a
  distance that morning, and which now stretched directly before his eyes. It
  came to him that this was the capital of Aphur&mdash;the palace of that
  Jadgor Prince Lakkon had mentioned, brother of Naia's mother, as he was to
  learn. Bent on seeing the man who aspired to Tamarizia's imperial throne at
  close quarters, he willed himself toward the far-flung white pile.</p>

  <p>It was built of stone he did not know, as he found when he came down to
  the broad, paved esplanade before it. But the substance seemed to be between
  a marble and an onyx, as nearly as he could judge. It stretched for the best
  part of an earth-mile and housed the entire working force of the Aphur
  government, as he came to know in the following days.</p>

  <p>Now, however, he gave more attention to his immediate
  surroundings&mdash;the vast towers on either side of the monstrous entrance,
  heavy and imposing and each flanked by guardian figures of what seemed winged
  dogs, whose front legs supported webbed membranes from body to paw.</p>

  <p>Croft passed between them through the entrance where flowed
  counter-streams of Palosians, on foot or dashing past in gnuppa- drawn
  chariot's, trundling on two wheels, and driven by men clad in cuirasses and
  belted with short swords.</p>

  <p>He entered a vast court, surrounded by colonnades, reached by sloping
  inclines and stairs and paved with a dull red stone. Here stood more of the
  chariots before the doors of this or that office of state. Blue porters moved
  about it, sprinkling the pavement with cooling streams of water from metal
  tanks strapped to their shoulders and fitted with a curved nozzle and
  spraying device.</p>

  <p>It made a splendid picture as the sun struck down on the red floor, the
  gaily-trapped gnuppas, the metal of the chariots and the flashing armor on
  the bodies of those who rode them, or the men at arms who stood here and
  there about the court, armed with sword and spear. This was the heart of
  Aphur's life, Croft thought, gave it a glance, and set off in quest of
  Aphur's king.</p>

  <p>He passed through vast chambers of audience, of council, or banqueting and
  reception, as he judged from the furnishing of each place. He passed other
  courts, marveling always at the blending of grace with strength in the
  construction of the whole. Also, he marveled at the richness of the draperies
  with which various rooms and doorways and arches were hung. Much of it seemed
  to possess a metallic quality in texture. It seemed like thin-spun gold. Yet
  it was everywhere about the palace as he passed. Finally he paused. He was
  getting nowhere. He decided there was but one means of attaining his desire.
  He put it into force. He willed himself into the presence of Jadgor without
  further search.</p>

  <p>Thereafter he was in a room, where, beside a huge wine-red table, two men
  sat. The one was Prince Lakkon, whom he knew. The other was even a larger
  man&mdash;heavy-set, dark of complexion, with grizzled hair, and a mouth held
  so tightly by habit that it gave the impression of lips consciously
  compressed. His eyes were dark as those of a bird. His nose high and somewhat
  bent at the middle of the bridge. The whole face was that of a man of driving
  purpose, who would brook small hindrance between himself and a predetermined
  goal.</p>

  <p>Aside from that, however, there was little of the king about him, since he
  was clad simply in a loose, white tunic, out of which his neck rose massive,
  below which his lower limbs showed, corded with muscle and strong. Plainly
  Jadgor was talking state business with his brother-in-law at ease.</p>

  <p>As Croft gained the room Jadgor struck the table at which he sat with
  clenched fist.</p>

  <p>"Cathur must still guard the gateway with Aphur, Prince Lakkon!" he cried.
  "Let Zollaria plan. Cathur's mountains make her impregnable now as fifty
  years before. Had Mazhur been other than a low-lying country she had never
  fallen victim to Zollaria's greed. But Cathur must be assured in her loyalty
  to the state."</p>

  <p>"Her loyalty?" Prince Lakkon exclaimed. "What does Aphur's king mean?"</p>

  <p>"What he says." Jadgor set his lips quite firmly. "Scythys is king&mdash;a
  dotard! Kyphallos is what&mdash;a fop&mdash;a voluptuary, as you
  know&mdash;as all Tamarizia knows. When he mounts the throne&mdash;as he
  doubtless will since there seems none to oppose him&mdash;what will Zollaria
  do? Cathur, since Mazhur was taken, stands alone&mdash;secure in her
  mountains, it is true, but alone, none the less. And Cathur guards the
  western gate to the inland sea.</p>

  <p>"Fifty years ago Zollaria meant to take Cathur as well, and she failed.
  The capture of Mazhur, save the territorial addition to her borders, gave her
  nothing at which she aimed. True, she has now a seaport at Niera, yet to what
  end? We hold the gate and the mouths to all rivers opening into the sea. Yet
  has Zollaria ceased to prate of a freedom of the seas? You know she has not.
  With Kyphallos on Cathur's throne, will she seek to gain by craft what was
  denied to her arms?"</p>

  <p>"But Kyphallos himself?" Lakkon objected as Jadgor paused.</p>

  <p>"Kyphallos!" The heavy shoulders of Aphur's monarch shrugged. "List ye
  Lakkon! Zollaria is strong. Cathur stands alone. Cathur guards the gate.
  Aphur could not hold it alone. Think you our foemen to the north have ceased
  of their ambition or to plan or prepare, while Tamarizia, wounded by Mazhur's
  loss, has licked her wounds for fifty years&mdash;and what now?
  Tamhys&mdash;Zitu knows I mean no unjust criticism of a nobleman&mdash;is one
  who believes in peace. So, too, do I, if peace can be enjoyed without the
  sacrifice of the innate right of man to regulate his own ways of life. Yet
  were I on the throne at Zitra, do you think I would ignore the possible peril
  to the north? No! I would prepare to meet move by move should the occasion
  arise."</p>

  <p>"And your first step?" Lakkon asked.</p>

  <p>"To make sure of Cathur," Jadgor said.</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>Jadgor leaned toward his companion before he replied.</p>

  <p>"I would take a lesson from Zollaria herself. Lakkon, we have
  lived&mdash;each state too much in itself. Tamarizia is a loosely-held
  collection of states, each ruled by what&mdash;a nominal king and a state
  assembly? And those assemblies in turn elect the central ruler&mdash;the
  emperor of the nation&mdash;to serve for ten Palosian cycles.</p>

  <p>"Zollaria is what? A nation ruled by one man and a circle of advisors,
  whose word is ultimate law. How was that brought about? By
  intermarriage&mdash;by making the governing house of Zollaria one, bound
  wholly together by a common interest without regard to anything else save
  that. Hence, let us make the interests of Aphur and Cathur one, and let us
  not delay."</p>

  <p>"By intermarriage?"</p>

  <p>"Aye. With the right princess on Cathur's throne Kyphallos might be
  swayed, and certainly nothing would transpire without our gaining word."</p>

  <p>"You have such an one in mind?" Lakkon asked.</p>

  <p>"Aye. I plan not so vaguely, Lakkon. I would give him the fairest maid of
  Aphur to wife. It would require such to hold a man of his type. Do you know
  that inside the last cycle he has been seen frequently at Niera, mingling
  with the Zollarian nobles who come to summer there?"</p>

  <p>"So I have heard rumored." Prince Lakkon inclined his head. "But this
  woman?"</p>

  <p>"Your daughter Naia," Jadgor declared.</p>

  <p>"Naia! Your sister's own child!" Prince Lakkon half rose from his
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Hilka!" Jadgor waved him back. "Stop, Lakkon! She is beautiful as Ga, the
  mother of Azil. It is because of her Kyphallos comes to Himyra now. I, Jadgor
  of Aphur, sent him the invitation with this in mind for Tamarizia's good. The
  betrothal must be agreed upon before he returns. Lakkon, I speak as your
  king."</p>

  <p>Prince Lakkon's face seemed to Croft to age, to grow drawn and somewhat
  pale as he bowed to his king's command. He looked to Croft, indeed, as Jason
  knew he himself felt. Never had he seen Prince Kyphallos of Cathur, yet he
  had heard him mentioned that morning in Lakkon's coach. He had heard Naia's
  soft lips utter sincere disgust of the lecherous young noble. Now
  Naia&mdash;the woman he himself loved&mdash;was planned a sacrifice to policy
  of state. Every atom of his soul cried out in revolt&mdash;"not
  that&mdash;not that." He might not win her himself, as he very well knew. Yet
  he had seen her&mdash;known her, loved her. A sick loathing evoked by
  Jadgor's plan waked in his soul. The thought of her surrender to the foul
  embrace of the northern prince roused within him a rebellion so vast that his
  senses whirled.</p>

  <p>Lakkon rose slowly. His features were dull and his voice a monotone of
  feeling too deep for an accent of expression.</p>

  <p>"King of Aphur, I shall inform the maid that she is chosen a sacrifice,"
  he said. "I know her mind. She loathes this Prince of Cathur in her
  heart."</p>

  <p>"Yet other women have sacrificed themselves to their nation in Tamarizia's
  history," Jadgor replied.</p>

  <p>"I shall place the matter before her in that light," Lakkon informed him,
  and turned to leave the room.</p>

  <p>Croft left, too, flitting out of the palace and once more taking up his
  own purposeless wandering about the town.</p>

  <p>Naia, Naia, Naia, his soul cried out within him! Naia, mate of his
  spirit!&mdash;sweet, pure maid of gold.. Would that he had a body here on the
  planet of Palos! He would fight this monstrous step, he told himself, to the
  death! He would seize this golden girl and bear her
  away&mdash;somewhere&mdash;anywhere, beyond the reach, the touch of the satyr
  Prince of Cathur. He would prevent this intended sacrifice of all that was
  holy in human existence-or die in the attempt!</p>

  <p>Here and there he made his way among the life of Himyra, torn by an agony
  of thought. Dimly he saw where he went&mdash;through the stables of the
  mighty caravans full of the ungainly sarpelcas&mdash; through what seemed a
  market of cattle, where were droves of the long-haired taburs and herds of
  other creatures like monster sheep save that they had huge pendulous udders,
  evidently the source of the nation's supply of milk.</p>

  <p>He noted these things without being fully aware of the fact at the time.
  Only later did he recall them as objects beheld before. In a similar fashion
  he came upon the barracks of troops guarding the various gates in the great
  wall, entered them, passed through them, found Himyra's weapons no more than
  strong bows and swords and spears, her soldiery, sturdy-looking fellows clad
  in leathern tunics.</p>

  <p>Yet not for one instant did the tumult in his senses cease as he passed
  from scene to scene. Always was the thought of Naia with him. Always was his
  spirit hot in revolt against the plan of Aphur's king. And so in the end
  thoughts of Naia seemed to draw him back in a circuit to Lakkon's palace
  where was the girl herself.</p>

  <p>He reached it and paused outside its doors. They were open. The
  copper-hued chariot drawn by the four plumed gnuppas stood before them, with
  Chythron back of the reins.</p>

  <p>Bazka, too, stood between the open leaves of the portal, and across the
  crystal pavement, leading to them, Lakkon was leading Naia toward the
  coach.</p>

  <p>While Jason watched, Aphur's prince and his daughter entered the
  conveyance and the great doors closed. Chythron spoke to the gnuppas and they
  sprang into their stride. Quite as he had done that morning Croft entered the
  carriage and crouched on the padded cushion where Naia already reclined.
  Where they were going, he did not know. Nor did he care, so long as she lay
  there before his eyes.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI. &mdash; A VIRGIN'S PRAYER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR a time as they turned toward the city gate, which they
  had entered that morning, silence held between Prince Lakkon and his
  child.</p>

  <p>Lakkon broke it himself at last. "All is arranged as you thought best, my
  Naia?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Aye, my father." She turned her eyes. "The messengers have departed to
  the mountains for the snows; the servants are cleaning. I have ordered the
  tables set in the crystal court, inside the hedge, and I have arranged for a
  band of dancers and musicians on the appointed day."</p>

  <p>"And the robe. You did not forget the new robe?" Lakkon smiled.</p>

  <p>Naia shook her head, her eyes dancing.</p>

  <p>"I am a woman," she replied. "The makers came at my summons to take my
  measure. It will be ready on the seventh day from this."</p>

  <p>"That is well," Prince Lakkon said. But he sighed.</p>

  <p>And suddenly Naia's face lost its light and grew sweetly brooding. She
  stretched out a rounded arm and touched him on the breast.</p>

  <p>"You are tired, my father," she spoke in almost crooning fashion, edging
  nearer to him.</p>

  <p>"The day with Uncle Jadgor has left you weary."</p>

  <p>"Aye, somewhat," Lakkon confessed.</p>

  <p>With a swift yet powerful gesture, he reached out and swept her into his
  arms, drawing her against his massive chest and sinking his cheek to touch
  her golden hair.</p>

  <p>"Naia, my daughter, thou knowest that I love you well," he said.</p>

  <p>Croft quivered in his being. It seemed to him he was looking into Lakkon's
  heart and reading there all his lips held back&mdash;the fatherly love, the
  fatherly pain, attendant on that scene in Jadgor's apartment, where he had
  spent much of the day. It was that, he felt, inspired that sudden, almost
  hungry clasping of the girl's supple figure to the father's breast&mdash;that
  almost plaintive cry for her assurance of her faith in his love.</p>

  <p>But Naia seemed not to sense any deeper reason than the mere love between
  them expressed. Her red lips parted, and she laughed softly as she lay
  against him, lifting a hand to his gray-shot hair.</p>

  <p>"Know that you love me?" she repeated. "Think you I could doubt it? Did
  you not give me my life? Do we not love what we create&mdash; so long as it
  comes from ourselves?"</p>

  <p>She nestled her head in the hollow of his corded neck. Above that
  gold-crowned head the man's face worked.</p>

  <p>"We were happy the day of thy birth, thy mother and I," he said.</p>

  <p>And now it seemed that at last the woman sensed some trouble unexpressed
  in the mind of the man. Very gently she released herself and sat up on the
  padded cushion. Her almost purple eyes looked full into those of her
  parent.</p>

  <p>"Concerning what did you speak with Uncle Jadgor to-day?"</p>

  <p>"Concerning thee."</p>

  <p>Lakkon met the issue fairly now that it confronted him at last.</p>

  <p>"Concerning me?"</p>

  <p>To Croft every line of Naia's figure stiffened.</p>

  <p>"Aye." Prince Lakkon sat up. He spoke swiftly, briefly, and paused. Yet
  ere he paused he had fully outlined all King Jadgor planned.</p>

  <p>And while he spoke the eyes of the woman widened swiftly, as the iris
  stretched, to leave her pupils deep wells of horror.</p>

  <p>Then as Lakkon finished speaking she cried out: "No!" in swift instinctive
  protest, and lifted herself upon her pink bent knees to poise so an instant
  before she flung herself once more upon her father's breast.</p>

  <p>"No!" she cried again, clinging to him. "No, no! Not that&mdash;not that!
  Father, unsay it! Give me not to that beast!"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" Prince Lakkon stayed her. "Chythron will hear your outcry."</p>

  <p>"Chythron!" she exclaimed. "Not Chythron but all Aphur&mdash;all Tamarizia
  shall hear my outcry against what Jadgor intends&mdash;every woman in the
  nation shall give thanks to Azil and Ga, that she stands not in my
  place."</p>

  <p>"Naia." Her father spoke in a voice not wholly steady.</p>

  <p>"Would you profane a shrine, sully a temple, defile a sacred thing?" she
  flared. "Is a virgin's body a thing to be bartered and sold in Aphur? Does my
  uncle regard me as a shameless creature who sells herself for a price? Azil
  and his holy mother would veil their faces from such marriage rites."</p>

  <p>"Think not I wish it," her father said. "Yet can I not deny the truth of
  Jadgor's words, or that the union of the houses of the two states would work
  for Tamarizia's great good."</p>

  <p>Naia was panting. "Tamarizia's?" she faltered now.</p>

  <p>"Aye, did you not comprehend what I said concerning the welfare of our
  nation?" Lakkon asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I&mdash;I think horror must have dulled, my
  understanding," she said. "Explain to me again."</p>

  <p>Long since they had left the city gates and were following a well-built
  road which led off toward those mountains where Croft had first stood and
  viewed the Palosian landscape in the light of this waning day.</p>

  <p>As he reached the end of his second exposition of the facts Prince Lakkon
  turned and suddenly swept aside the purple curtain which draped the side of
  the coach. He flung out an arm and pointed straight to where the dull red
  walls of Himyra still shone in the afternoon rays.</p>

  <p>"Behold Himyra, jewel on the breast of Aphur," he cried. "There she lies.
  Think you I would have given ear to Jadgor's plans save for that? Think you I
  would send you, flesh of my loins, to such a union save for the good of
  unborn souls to come? Think you were it not for Himyra, Aphur, Tamarizia
  herself, I would, have bowed my head to the words of Aphur's king? Nay. If
  so, you are wrong. But for Tamarizia and that glory and honor which are hers
  and have been for a thousand cycles of our sun, a true son of the nation must
  sink all thoughts of self, must live, if by living he can serve, or should it
  serve better, must&mdash;die!"</p>

  <p>Despite himself Croft thrilled at the words, such as only a true patriot
  might speak in such tones of fire&mdash;tones which quivered and pulsed with
  emotion one might not deny. In spite of his own sorry rebellion of spirit,
  echoed, as he now knew, in the soul of the gentle girl before him, some
  feeling akin to pity for this royal father of hers crept through his mind.
  Prince Lakkon was a man torn between parental love and the love of his
  nation&mdash; destined, as it seemed, to suffer, no matter how this thing
  fell out.</p>

  <p>And while he spoke, the girl, his child, flesh of his flesh, crept to his
  side, to kneel and gaze out at the distant walls of the city she knew as her
  own. Her expression changed. Some of the indefinable quality of girlhood
  seemed to fall from her and expose the deeper, firmer woman's nature, as
  though a veil had been torn aside.</p>

  <p>"And I must live for her&mdash;with&mdash;Kyphallos?" she whispered
  tensely as Lakkon once more paused.</p>

  <p>"If you can win him&mdash;hold him&mdash;sway him&mdash;with Jadgor on the
  throne at Zitra you will have made Tamarizia strong."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;will have made&mdash;Tamarizia&mdash;strong."</p>

  <p>O girl of gold! Croft's heart cried out as he caught her scanning speech.
  O wonderful woman&mdash;so true to womanhood&mdash;so true now to the spirit
  of ultimate woman, ultimate sacrifice through which attribute of woman comes
  life itself!</p>

  <p>Unseen, unknown to her or the man who rode beside her, Croft approached
  and bent above her in that moment of struggle and decision. For, as she
  turned her eyes back to the interior of the coach. Croft knew she had
  decided, and that in deciding she had chosen the path which led against every
  personal impulse of her own clean spirit.</p>

  <p>"What am I against Tamarizia?" she said.</p>

  <p>"You are my daughter and I love you," said Lakkon, Aphur's prince.</p>

  <p>"I know." Naia crept to him and laid herself in his arms. "I know," she
  murmured after a time of silence.</p>

  <p>Lakkon's arms tightened about her as the coach swung along. Her arm crept
  up and stole about his neck. Silence came down again save for the patter of
  the gnuppa's feet on the stone surface of the highway which had now left the
  plain and begun to scale the mountain-side.</p>

  <p>Crouched invisible, Croft turned his gaze from the man and woman to stare
  out between the fluttering curtains. The road came to an end in a mountain
  valley, open toward the east and so unveiled a fresh scene of beauty to
  Jason's eyes. Here was a country palace, gleaming white above a series of
  terraced gardens which rose from the shores of a tiny mountain lake. Toward
  it Chythron guided his steeds along a private drive which branched off from
  the highway they had traversed thus far.</p>

  <p>As though the turning had been a signal, Naia loosened the embrace which
  held her and sat up, still without speaking, before Chythron brought his team
  to a stand. Then, as in the morning, Prince Lakkon helped her to descend and
  walked beside her up a low, broad flight of steps to reach the portals of
  their home.</p>

  <p>At their heels Croft followed on. His eyes swept the scope of the valley
  so far as he could mark it from the steps.</p>

  <p>Groups of the woolly, sheep-like cattle he had seen in Himyra fed in the
  lush grass of mountain meadows. Cultivated fields stretched out before his
  eyes. At the top of the steps he turned briefly, and looked off to the east.
  There his eyes caught the glint of distant sun-kissed water&mdash;the Central
  Sea, of which Prince Lakkon had spoken, he now believed. Then the portals
  before which Lakkon and Naia stood swung open, and once more a blue native
  appeared. Beside him was a monster beast, similar in all respects to those
  Croft had seen harnessed to the tiny trams in the cargo tunnels. It marked
  the advent of Lakkon and Naia with a slow wagging of its tail, and suddenly
  rearing, laid its huge front paws, one on each of the girl's shoulders.</p>

  <p>She spoke to the creature softly, and when it dropped back, at her
  command, she patted its head. Then, turning to the man of Mazzer, who stood
  waiting, she uttered a command: "I am going to my apartments, Miltos; send
  Maia to me there."</p>

  <p>"You will attend me later&mdash;over our evening viands?" her father
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Aye, presently," she returned as she moved toward a stair at one end of
  the entrance court, which, in a smaller way, was not unlike Prince Lakkon's
  Himyra palace, save that here its pavement was laid in alternate squares of
  pale yellow and dull red. The treads of the stairway, also, were of yellow
  and red, as Croft saw while mounting, and the pillars which supported the
  balcony were yellow, while the balcony itself was red.</p>

  <p>Here, too, as in the city, a group of white sculpture stood at the foot of
  the stair. It depicted a very Hercules of a man throttling a creature not far
  unlike a tiger, while behind him crouched a woman, holding a tiny figure of a
  child.</p>

  <p>All this he saw as Naia ascended without pause, reached a door, guarded by
  a heavy golden curtain, swept it aside and entered into her own room.</p>

  <p>Here, as In Himyra, Croft found couch and chairs, and windows, the mirror
  basin, the pedestal, and the winged figure poised as though for flight.</p>

  <p>Once more the golden curtain was drawn back and a young Mazzer woman
  appeared.</p>

  <p>Naia turned. "Maia, how is the pool?"</p>

  <p>"It should be delightful, princess," the blue girl replied. "All this day
  Zitu warmed it with his light."</p>

  <p>Naia tapped with her foot. "Procure fresh raiment and bring it thither,"
  she said. "The ride was tiresome and I will bathe."</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, accompanied by Maia, who bore fresh robes, she left
  the room and led the way to one end of the corridor and through a small door
  to an outer stair. Descending that she passed through a sort of sunken
  garden, laid out in odd geometric designs and planted with shrubs and trees
  and flowers, among which gleamed the white of ornamental urns, fire-urns, and
  statues, toward a low, white wall in which an opening appeared. Passing this,
  she turned about the angle of a protecting inner stone screen and stood on
  the margin of an open bath, its water clear as crystal and tinted a delicate
  amber from the yellow bottom and sides of the peculiar onyx-like stone.</p>

  <p>Naia bathed. Refusing to spy upon her, Croft waited without the concealing
  wall, while twilight fell and the sounds of soft splashings came to his ear.
  The bath took a long time. Croft fancied the girl found some vague comfort in
  the soft, warm kiss of the waters, tempered all day by the sun&mdash;that to
  lie wrapped in their liquid caress soothed somewhat her spirit, torn by the
  revelations her recent journey had held.</p>

  <p>While he waited twilight deepened, and after a time a softer light stole
  through the garden. He lifted his gaze to the skies. Three moons hung there,
  casting their blended light over mountain and valley and plain. Vaguely he
  wondered which of the three he had visited during the night before&mdash;that
  night with its weird experience, ending on the edge of this day, which, after
  all, had been but little less weird&mdash;this day in which he had found and
  recognized and yielded to the one feminine counterpart of his nature, only to
  find her destined to another less worthy than himself, and to know himself
  unable to intervene between her and her fate.</p>

  <p>While he sat there brooding the whole strange situation&mdash;a man in all
  save material body&mdash;a consciousness, suffering all the pangs of spirit
  he was unable to physically express, Naia came forth and moved with her
  accompanying servant, a pure, white figure, through the garden to the
  house.</p>

  <p>Like her shadow. Croft pursued her every step. He stood beside her while
  she sat waiting for the evening meal. He was behind her when she reclined on
  the couch beside the table, opposite her father, and ate. He dogged her steps
  when she once more sought the quiet of her room, and bade Maia leave her for
  the night.</p>

  <p>Hence he witnessed what no other eyes beheld as the flaring oil lamp, with
  its guttering wick little better than a candle extinguished, and the
  apartment flooded only by the light of the Palosian moons, she knelt by the
  mirror basin, before the winged figure on the wine-red pedestal.</p>

  <p>And he heard what no other ears save her own could hear as she lifted her
  hands to the figure before which she knelt&mdash;the cry of her
  soul&mdash;her womanhood's suppliant prayer.</p>

  <p>"O, Azil, Giver of Life, must this be forced upon me? O Ga, Mother of
  Azil&mdash;thou virgin woman, whom Zitu ordained the one to give an angel
  life, that he might speak to men of Zitu himself and teach them how to live,
  do thou intercede for me! Thou knowest woman guards the sacred flame, which
  is life itself; so that it burns clear and never-ceasing. Must that flame in
  me be fouled? Ga the Mother, Azil the Son&mdash;Azil the Angel&mdash;hear ye
  my prayer!"</p>

  <p>She ceased and knelt on, silent, with hands clasped and lovely head bowed
  down.</p>

  <p>And once more it seemed to Croft that his senses went spinning, eddying,
  whirling around. Azil the Giver of Life. Ga the mother of Azil the Son. A
  Virgin and a Child. And Zitu the father&mdash;God. She prayed to them.</p>

  <p>This was the Palosian religion, at least, in part. Strange analogy to the
  earth-creed Croft found it&mdash;to the creed in which he had been raised.
  Zitu was the one creative source here as elsewhere, no matter by what name
  called&mdash;the source to which the projected atoms of its thought looked
  back, to whom they lifted their voices in praise or prayer. What did it
  matter whether on earth or Palos, life was then the same, and the source was
  one place as another, all-embracing, universal, always the same? And Azil the
  Angel of Life was what? A Messianic spirit, surely, which had come to speak
  to the human atoms and tell them of the source. What else? And Ga&mdash;the
  medium, through which spirit was translated into matter&mdash;the eternal
  woman, through whom Life came to the incarnated man.</p>

  <p>And to these, this maid&mdash;this other woman who had pledged herself as
  a sacrifice for her nation, prayed. Alone here before the pedestal shrine of
  Azil, Son of Zitu, she knelt and asked that the cup she had promised to drink
  might be divinely removed from her lips since all human hope of such a
  removal seemed to have died in so far as she could know.</p>

  <p>Should that prayer go unheeded or unheard? Could the pure cry of a clean
  spirit fail to reach the listening ears of the source?</p>

  <p>No! Croft's spirit cried the word to his soul. No, no! A thousand times
  no! Somehow, some way, he knew not how that prayer must be heard and
  answered.</p>

  <p>He tore himself free from the spell of the kneeling figure, and with no
  definite purpose in his going save to remove himself from a privacy upon
  which he felt he must no longer intrude, went blindly out of the room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">VII. &mdash; KYPHALLOS AND KALAMITA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">YET once outside the mountain villa, Croft knew where he
  wanted to go. It was back to Himyra&mdash;back to the palace of Lakkon
  itself&mdash;to be alone with his thoughts. To that point, therefore, he once
  more willed himself.</p>

  <p>The city swam beneath him. The yellow Na sparkled and glinted in the
  flickering gleams of the fire basins lighted along the embankments as they
  leaped and flared. Other fires flashed out in various of the public squares.
  And here the population met for their hours of relaxation. Here groups of
  wandering musicians played on reed and harp and horn as the gaily-decked
  crowds filed by. Here mountebanks plied their stock of tricks and acrobats
  proved their supple agility and strength. Over it all the three moons of
  Palos poured a silvery light as Croft flitted past.</p>

  <p>Then he was at the palace of Lakkon, finding still open a window of Naia's
  own room, and so at length the place he sought. The moonlight filtered in. It
  fell in a broad bank, which struck across the pure white figure of Azil with
  its outstretched wings.</p>

  <p>Through a long moment Croft stood gazing at the statue, bathed in the
  light of the moons. Then, without removing his eyes, he found the couch and
  sat down upon it, and thought, still staring at Azil&mdash;the material
  symbol of that spirit to whom the girl, the aura of whose presence pervaded
  this room, had prayed.</p>

  <p>And, after a time, out of all his agony of spirit, his tumult of thought,
  his rebellion at what was proposed for the girl's fate, the sick knowledge of
  his own futility to aid her, there came to him a prompting impulse as to his
  future course. To what end he did not know. In his present state he could do
  nothing and knew it&mdash;had raged at the knowledge ever since he had seen
  Naia of Aphur on her way to this room, where he now sat.</p>

  <p>Yet despite the acknowledged fact of impotency, something seemed to urge
  him to go on, to learn all he might of Palos and its people, of Tamarizia and
  its history, its manners and customs, its government and laws, and more
  particularly the true state of things in Cathur and the truth concerning
  Kyphallos, son of Cathur's king.</p>

  <p>To Cathur then would he go, Croft decided, while he sat there staring at
  Azil, the Angel of Life. And Cathur, he judged, lay toward the north since
  Jadgor had spoken of the state of Nodhur as lying beyond Aphur on the Na.
  Hence he willed his spirit in projection without further delay.</p>

  <p>Thereafter followed a week in which Jason Croft, disembodied spirit,
  learned much concerning the nation and the country to which he had dared
  venture across millions of miles of space.</p>

  <p>He found Cathur, a mountainous state lying to the north of a wide
  mountain-walled strait. He found Scira, its capital city, not unlike Himyra
  save that it was built of an odd blue stone quarried from the mountains which
  ribbed the state in all directions. There was white stone, too, used in the
  governmental palace, and also in a splendid collection of buildings lying on
  a small plateau above the city proper. This was the National University, of
  Tamarizia, as Jason quickly learned, once he was inside its walls.</p>

  <p>Endowed as he was with the peculiar ability of reading the words of the
  people by reason of his sublimated state, he found this school a wonderful
  means of quickly gaining all knowledge of the nation which he desired to
  know. He literally went to school, an unknown scholar who listened to the
  recitation of classes and the lectures of grave professorial men clad in long
  robes of spotless white. Geography held his interest mainly at first.</p>

  <p>He learned that Tamarizia lay upon a continent holding itself completely
  surrounded save for the narrow strait, a vast central sea, studded here and
  there with islands, the major of which, Hiranur, some fifty miles long by
  twenty wide, was the seat of the imperial throne at the city of Zitra, of
  which Jadgor had made mention before. The Tamarizian states bordered this
  central ocean&mdash;or had done so before the Zollarian war had wrested
  Mazhur, on the extreme north shore, from the original group of states.</p>

  <p>East of Mazhur lay Bithur. South of that was Milidhur, completing the
  eastern side of the Central Sea. Aphur joined Milidhur on the west&mdash;its
  name literally meaning "the state to the west," and south of Milidhur and
  Aphur was Nodhur, gaining outlet for its commerce by means of the river
  Na.</p>

  <p>Cathur lay west of Mazhur, north of the strait, to the outer ocean,
  completing the circle. Its name might be translated as "the battle-ground,"
  which, in fact, it was, Zollaria having more than once sought to conquer it
  and lost because of the nature of its mountainous terrain. Having learned so
  much, he could readily see wherein the possession of this state would give
  Zollaria the freedom of the seas, which she desired, and a joint control of
  the entire Central Sea.</p>

  <p>From geography he turned to sociology and science. He found out quickly
  that the Tamarizians used a metric system, numbering their population by tens
  and dividing the national census on the basis of thousands and tens of
  thousands, each thousand unit having a captain and each ten thousand a local
  governor. Their day was twenty-seven hours long, their year longer than that
  of earth, but divided into twelve periods or months, each in their belief
  ruled over by an angel designated by a symbolic sign. They believed in the
  immortality of the soul, as he had learned the first day. They believed in
  the resurrection of the dead. They used a system of social castes, to which
  the naturalized descendants of the Mazzerian nations belonged, being purely a
  caste of the lowest or serving type. The trades of fathers descended to sons,
  instruction in crafts and arts being largely by word of mouth alone. They had
  a bard or minstrel caste, a caste of dancers wholly female in its circle.</p>

  <p>A Palosian year was called a cycle, a day a sun, a month a Zitran&mdash;or
  period set by Zitu, the national God. There was a priesthood and a vestal
  order of women. Also, there was an order of knighthood, to which belonged men
  of noble blood or those raised to it by kingly decree for some signal
  accomplishment in the arts or sciences or some other service to the
  state.</p>

  <p>The royal house of each state was hereditary, but governed jointly with a
  state assembly elected by the vote of each ten thousand unit of population,
  each unit selecting a state delegate to the assembly. The imperial throne was
  filled by the choice of the states as he had once before heard Jadgor of
  Aphur, say.</p>

  <p>Agriculture was highly held and greatly specialized. Metal- working was a
  very advanced science, as he had already guessed. Copper was abundant, and
  the Tamarizians held the secret of tempering the metal now unknown on earth.
  Of it they made their weapons and most of their public structural metal,
  including their carriages and chariots and all conveyances of a finer sort.
  Gold was plentiful, too. But silver and lead were rare and held in high
  esteem. Steam and electricity were unknown in their application, as Croft had
  already seen.</p>

  <p>They had reached a high plane in art, sculpture and weaving. He discovered
  that the golden cloth was actually gold spun into threads and mixed with a
  vegetable fiber to form warp and woof.</p>

  <p>There was also a medical caste, somewhat crude, but seemingly efficient,
  so far as he could learn, and attached to it a female or nursing caste,
  consisting wholly again of women, who entered it from choice. In fact, women,
  as he came to see, held a prominent place in the nation. They held the right
  of suffrage. Their citizenship was coequal with their men. They sat in the
  classrooms of the university, as he actually saw, and even took part in
  public ceremonials and competed in the public games.</p>

  <p>All in all, before his week at Scira was past, he had come to understand
  that Tamarizia was a very democratic nation despite its form of royal
  rulership, and that the emperor of Zitra was little more than a relic of
  old-time government, with little more power than a republican president.</p>

  <p>And that, like most republics, the nation had grown weak in the pursuit of
  the profession of arms, he had to admit that Jadgor was right. Each city had
  a sort of civic guard&mdash;each unit of ten thousand possessed a military
  police. There was an imperial guard at Zitra of possibly five hundred men.
  Civic guards, imperial guards and police, the national maximum force none too
  well armed or trained would not be judged as aggregating over fifty thousand
  effective men.</p>

  <p>To the north of Tamarizia lay Zollaria, her western shore line that of the
  great or outer ocean. Like Tamarizia, Zollaria was a nation of whites,
  differing, however, in their national regime and their physical appearance to
  no small degree. As Jadgor had said to Lakkon, theirs was a rule of
  absolutism, first and last, with the governing class distinct from the common
  people in each detail of their life.</p>

  <p>Larger than Tamarizia, Zollaria looked with envy on the position of the
  country to the south. Fifty years before she had sought to change it and
  failed. Yet Jadgor was assured she had not laid aside her ambition, and Croft
  was inclined to agree.</p>

  <p>The Zollarians themselves were a light-haired race, to a great extent
  heavily built, strong, virile, sturdy, many of them blue- eyed, except in the
  southern part of the nation, where they approached more nearly to the
  Tamarizian type.</p>

  <p>East of Tamarizia and south of Zollaria, in the hinterland of the
  continent on which the three nations lived, was the half-savage tribe of
  Mazzer, the blue men, inhabiting a region consisting mainly of semitropic
  forests and plains, living largely by hunting and the exporting of skins and
  dried meats and natural fruits, together with a variety of cheese. In these
  articles they maintained commerce with Zollaria and Tamarizia, along their
  adjoining borders, and had done so for years. Commerce was entirely by water
  in such boats as Croft had seen on the Na, and by means of the sarpelca
  caravans across stretches of desert to regions not approachable by the
  streams.</p>

  <p>That week in school proved a rather peculiar experience to Croft. He came
  to feel actually at home in Scira. Without being seen or known he came to
  know the youths of the various classes.</p>

  <p>And to one in particular he gave special note. He was a wonderful man in
  so far as physique was concerned. He stood a good six feet in height and was
  built in perfect proportion. In the games and sports he always excelled
  because of his splendid strength. And there he ceased. Mentally he was not
  the equal of those with whom he strove.</p>

  <p>Nature seemed to have left her task uncompleted so far as Jasor was
  concerned. That was his name&mdash;Jasor, from Nodhur, the state to the south
  of Aphur as Croft learned by degrees. He was a lovable young man,
  mild-mannered, friendly and kind. But he was rated in his studies with youths
  two years his juniors and appeared unable to do more than maintain his
  standing with them. Watching him, Croft felt both pity and interest develop
  through the course of the seven days wherein he himself acquired so great an
  understanding of Palosian life. It seemed a pity to Croft that one so
  splendidly endowed with physical perfection should be so mentally weak. He
  rather followed young Jasor about and discovered to his pleasure that
  although seemingly well provided with means the youth was naturally of a
  cleanly life. More than that, through association with him, he came to know
  that Jasor felt his position acutely, and was brooding over his own mental
  capacity to an unwise degree.</p>

  <p>THROUGHOUT his stay in Cathur, however, Croft did not lose sight of his
  main object in coming to the northern state. He had come to find and judge
  Kyphallos for himself, and he attended to that, not the first night, as he
  had intended, but the next night after that. There was a reason for the
  delay. Kyphallos was not in Scira when Croft came to the capital of Cathur.
  Jason managed to see Scythys the king. He found him in a splendid room clad
  in a loose robe of scarlet, a senile husk of a once massive man, with a look
  of vague trouble in his half-blinded cataract-filmed eyes. But of Kyphallos
  the son there was no sign.</p>

  <p>Only by chance remarks was Croft able to learn the whereabouts of the
  prince. By such means he finally learned of a second palace maintained on an
  island in the Central Sea, off the coast of Cathur, not far from the border
  of the former Tamarizian state of Mazhur. The island was known as Anthra, was
  a part of the state of Cathur, and a favorite retreat with the crown
  prince.</p>

  <p>To Anthra on the second night Croft went. And on Anthra he plunged into
  such a scene as he had not met in Tamarizia as yet. Heretofore he had been
  struck with the mild beauty of Palosian life, with a sort of personal dignity
  which seemed to pervade the nation, despite the magnificence of their public
  structures and the undoubted wealth of the state.</p>

  <p>Not but what, being human, there was a percentage of criminality in the
  social life. Such things, as among other races, were known and recognized,
  but he had found it here regulated to a surprising extent.</p>

  <p>On Anthra, he came into an atmosphere the antithesis of this, combined
  with a degree of voluptuous luxury, cradled in a setting of utter
  magnificence.</p>

  <p>He came upon a saturnalia of pleasure. He could liken it to nothing else.
  A feast was in progress in the palace Kyphallos had made the scene of his
  private debauches for years.</p>

  <p>Above an artificial harbor as calm as glass, the palace rose an imposing
  pile. At the quays of the harbor, their colored sails picked out by flaming
  fire-urns, their gilded hulls set asparkie in the flicker of the light-giving
  flames, lay a number of elaborate pleasure craft, more like gold and copper
  galleys than anything else.</p>

  <p>Steps led up from the stone quays to the palace proper, giving on a wide
  expanse of crystal flagging, under a heavy portico supported by pillars of
  lemon-yellow stone. And beyond this, through wide arty arches, was the main
  court, in the center of which was a pool of limpid water, some fifty feet
  long by as many wide.</p>

  <p>Like the other Palosian palaces this central court was the main gathering
  place of the inmates and guests. On Anthra the structure was flagged in a
  pale-green stone. The pillars supporting the balcony about it were
  lemon-yellow, and the stairways at either end of a clear translucent blue.
  Innumerable oil-lamps lighted it this night, and about one corner of the
  central pool were arranged the tables for the feast.</p>

  <p>Here Croft found the man he sought, reclining on a padded divan, his
  too-full red lips slightly parted in a bibulous smile, his long hair curled
  and anointed and perfumed till he reeked of aromatic scents; his well-formed
  hands loaded with rings, his body clad in a crimson garment embroidered in
  gold.</p>

  <p>Beside him, lying outstretched like some splendid creature of the jungle
  as it came to Croft, was a woman; tawny as a lioness in the tint of her hair
  and heavy-lidded eyes, lithe as a lioness, too, in every sensuous line of her
  body, well nigh unclothed.</p>

  <p>Her sandalless feet were stained on the soles with crimson. Anklets
  gripped her lower limbs, and tinkled tiny golden bells as she moved.
  Bracelets banded her graceful naked arms. Gem- incrusted cups fastened by
  jeweled bands covered in part her breasts. A bit of gold gauze, studded with
  bright red stones, accentuated rather than veiled the rest of her perfect
  figure from waist to the bend of her knees. She lay there close to Kyphallos
  and after a bit she lifted a golden goblet and pressed it to his lips and
  laughed.</p>

  <p>Beyond her was a man, Croft marked at a glance. He was heavy, gross; yet
  gave an impression of mighty strength in the size of his hairy arms, the
  pillars of his mighty limbs, the breadth of his shoulder and chest. And he,
  too, was tawny haired.</p>

  <p>And, on the other side, of Kyphallos was a figure to give Croft pause. A
  blue warrior sat there; but surely no member of the serving class, Jason
  thought. This man was never made to serve. His were the features of one who
  commands, strong, firm-lipped, high-cheeked, with almost a somnolent sneer in
  the expression of his mouth and the glint of his eyes as he turned them on
  Kyphallos and the woman by his side. This was some Mazzerian chief&mdash;here
  in the palace of Cathur's prince. Who then were the tawny woman and man,
  Croft asked himself, and found he was soon to know.</p>

  <p>For as the woman laughed Kyphallos spoke. "Your laughter is music better
  than any I can offer, my Kalamita. Since first I heard it in Niera, the time
  I met you there with your brother, Bandhor, I have longed to hear it more.
  Your graciousness in coming to this farewell feast, ere I sail for Aphur,
  burdens me with debt. Yet were I loath to have sailed without a final sight
  of you&mdash;a parting word. And I have provided such entertainment as I
  might."</p>

  <p>"As you do always, Prince of Aphur," his companion responded. "Is it not
  true, Bandhor, my brother, that we are honored to be present when Cathur
  desires?"</p>

  <p>"Aye. Wine, food, music, and women. What more can a man desire?" the
  massive individual at whom she smiled over her rounded shoulder replied.
  "When Cathur returns, he must come to our house at Niera as he has done
  before. There are others of Zollaria I desire him to meet, as well as other
  men of Mazzer, besides the noble Bazd, whom we made bold to bring with us
  tonight."</p>

  <p>As he finished the blue man smiled and Kyphallos picking up his own goblet
  of wine passed it to the Mazzerian with a languid grace.</p>

  <p>"Thy friends are my friends, O Bandhor of Zollaria!" he exclaimed, and
  bending close to the face of the girl said: "Shall I come when I return from
  Aphur?"</p>

  <p>And as he gazed upon her the heavy lids slowly contracted until her eyes
  narrowed to slits. Then they shot up, fully open, and she flashed him a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Aye, my Kyphallos, unless you desire me to suffer, come when you
  return."</p>

  <p>Kyphallos took back the cup from which Bazd, the Mazzerian, had drunk and
  drained it at a gulp. "I shall come," he shouted and clapped his hands. "Let
  the entertainment begin!"</p>

  <p>After that Croft could only watch and, marvel at what he beheld. A sound
  of harps burst forth. Golden and scarlet curtains drew apart at one end of
  the immense court. He caught a glimpse of moving figures behind them, and
  then fifty dancing-girls broke forth. Swaying, posturing, gesturing they
  moved down the hall toward the tables. At first they were clothed. But as
  they advanced they dropped veil after veil from their posturing bodies, until
  they gleamed white and pink, swinging figures caught in the eddies of the
  dance. Closer and closer they came. They reached the tables themselves. They
  sprang upon them. They danced among the remnants of the feast. The hands of
  the guests&mdash; other companions of Cathur's prince, reached toward
  them&mdash;sought to capture them and draw them down upon the divans.</p>

  <p>And then the music ceased. Crying aloud, the dancers leaped from the table
  into the pool. Like nymphs they swam across it and disappeared behind a
  curtain of flowers and shrubs at the farther end. Yet in a moment they were
  back, dragging what looked like a monster shell in which sat the figure of an
  aged man, carrying yet another shell in his hand, and wearing a long green
  robe.</p>

  <p>This they launched in the pool, and seizing ropes fastened to it, they
  swam back toward the tables, towing it along. At the corner of the pool they
  clustered on each side, while the aged passenger rose and stepped to
  land.</p>

  <p>Kyphallos rose, too. "Hail Kronhor&mdash;Ruler of the Seas!" he'
  exclaimed. "I am about to entrust myself to your domain for a journey to the
  south. What fare may I expect?"</p>

  <p>"Good, O Prince of Cathur," the aged one returned. "I shall instruct all
  handmaids to wait upon you and steer your ship in safety, even as they have
  brought me into your presence to- night."</p>

  <p>Kyphallos, filled a goblet with wine and held it out.</p>

  <p>He who played Kronhor took it.</p>

  <p>"Drink!" the Cathurian cried. "Cathur does honor to Kronhor&mdash;
  thus."</p>

  <p>Kalamita sprang to her feet. She filled other goblets, swiftly motioning
  the others about the tables to do the same. "Drink!" her voice rang out.
  "Drink to Kronhor. Drink to Kyphallos and the safety of his voyage."</p>

  <p>The toast was drunk. Kronhor made his adieus and was towed back to the
  other side of the pool. Kalamita was leaning with both hands locked over
  Kyphallos's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she whispered. "Why does Jadgor of Aphur ask your presence, my
  friend?"</p>

  <p>"I know not," said the Cathurian prince. "Some business of state, no
  doubt, to which I must attend for my father, who grows feeble with age as you
  know."</p>

  <p>The dancing girls were hauling the shell from the pool. They made what
  looked like a straining group in pink bisque.</p>

  <p>"It was a pretty play," Kalamita murmured. "Did you design-it, Kyphallos?
  I know from the past you are clever."</p>

  <p>The man turned and looked once more into her eyes. "I designed it&mdash;I
  planned it to amuse&mdash;you."</p>

  <p>Croft turned away. He had seen enough. This was the man to whom it was
  planned to give the woman he&mdash;Jason Croft&mdash;loved; that sweet, pure
  Naia of Aphur who had knelt two nights ago in appeal before Azil the Angel of
  Life. This scented sensualist, caught fast in the charms of a Zollarian
  woman, of a type Croft could not mistake. Jadgor had hinted at something like
  this in his talk with Lakkon two days before. And to-night&mdash;on the eve
  of his departure of Aphur, Kyphallos of Cathur sat as the host of the enemies
  of his land. Surely Jadgor had reason for the fears he had expressed. Surely
  here was food for serious thought.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; APHUR ACCEPTS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CROFT left the court and made his way outside into the calm
  beauty of the night. Flooded by the moonlight, he stood watching the flicker
  of the fire-urns on the waters of the tiny harbor, where lay the gilded
  pleasure craft.</p>

  <p>And after a time he turned back, attracted by the fact that the inner
  lights had died. Only for a moment, however, did he remain inside. In the
  court, flooded now only by the moons, a wild and loathsome orgy was taking
  place between the dancing girls and the guests, in and about the pool. Cries,
  shrill laughter, sounds of splashing and fleeting glimpses of flitting shapes
  told him the full story as to the end of Kyphallos's feast. It sickened him,
  and once more he fled the spot to spend the night outside.</p>

  <p>Naia! The thought came to him. Suddenly he wanted to see her, be near her,
  away from this scene of brutal carnival where license reigned supreme. He
  wanted to be in the hills of Aphur, where she had her home. And swiftly he
  was.</p>

  <p>There was Lakkon's palace, white under the triple moons&mdash;and here was
  the window of the room where she had knelt and prayed. Invisible, yet seeing,
  he crept inside, like a wraith of the night. Only the moon gave him light.
  But it showed him the woman of his soul. She lay on the metal couch, asleep.
  Her fair hair shadowed her face as he bent above her.</p>

  <p>A slender arm was thrown out to one side. Coverings as light as silk
  betrayed the grace of her form. Her lips were half parted, and as Jason bent
  down, she sighed.</p>

  <p>Croft straightened and stood like a guardian spirit above her. His soul
  was once more on fire at the thought of what was planned. This was the girl
  who was to be offered to the lecherous young spawn of royalty, even now
  disporting himself with the tawny siren from another nation&mdash;that
  Kalamita, whose name, Croft knew, might best be translated into English as
  Magnet. Kalamita&mdash;the magnet&mdash;a human magnet&mdash;a female magnet
  to draw men to her by her shameless charms and bind them fast past any chance
  of escape.</p>

  <p>How much he wondered did Jadgor of Aphur really know of what was going on.
  How fully was he informed of what was coming now to seem, to Croft, as one
  side of the workings of Zollaria's plot? Surely he must know how much to be
  willing to sacrifice this fair young sleeper, his sister's child. Little by
  little Croft was coming to understand the workings of Jadgor's mind&mdash;to
  believe him a patriot really rather than a seeker of selfish power, such as
  he had fancied he might be for all his brave words at first.</p>

  <p>What then? Croft could not answer. Bound as he was&mdash;despite his
  ability to hear and see and know&mdash;he could do nothing in himself. All
  night long he raved in impotent rage, unknowing that by degrees he was
  solving the problem presented to him.</p>

  <p>At morn he went back to Anthra. He witnessed the departure of Kyphallos in
  a gilded galley with red sails and red silken cordage rowed by twenty blue
  men, ten to each bank of oars.</p>

  <p>Kalamita's barge, in which rode the Zollarian woman, her brother and Bazd
  the Mazzerian chief, accompanied the Cathurian for some two hours before it
  turned north and made off for Niera, as Croft gathered from what conversation
  passed.</p>

  <p>Kyphallos's craft continued south. Croft let him go. He himself went back
  to Scira and the national school for his lessons of the day. The Cathurian
  prince was safe for five days while he sailed and rowed to Himyra. Meanwhile
  Croft was determined to learn all. he could. It was after that he first met
  Jasor and studied him during the few days remaining until the first meeting
  between Kyphallos and Naia which he had determined to attend. And in so
  studying the youth, he discovered Jasor's full recognition of his own
  shortcomings, and that his knowledge of his own backward mental powers was
  preying upon his mind to produce a melancholic turn in the young man's
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>At night Jasor sat in his quarters brooding, or took long solitary walks.
  Even in the four days he lost flesh. Croft realized that his introspections
  were sapping the young Nodhurian's strength&mdash;that he was physically as
  well as mentally sick. He had drawn into himself and no longer took part in
  the games in which, not only the dares of his classmates, but his very
  stature, told Croft he had once excelled.</p>

  <p>Then came the seventh day, and Croft had willed himself back to Himyra
  once more, with an eye out for the galley from Anthra along the yellow
  Na.</p>

  <p>He found it a little below the city wall, and followed it as it worked its
  way up the current with flashing, dripping blades which rose and glistened
  and fell in the brilliant light. Under a scarlet awning, Kyphallos, curled
  and perfumed, lay on a burnished divan and watched the city slip past until
  the galley swung into one of the quays in front of the palace, where a
  chariot accompanied by a part of the royal guard waited as the galley moored.
  Meanwhile vast crowds lined the terraces along that portion of the Na and
  trumpets blared a greeting to the northern guest.</p>

  <p>The Cathurian came ashore and entered the burnished car. The detachment of
  the guards fell in on either side. The procession mounted the inclines from
  terrace to terrace, past the gathered throngs, until in the end it passed
  through the monster entrance of the palace and brought up in the principal
  court.</p>

  <p>There various nobles of the state, Lakkon among them, waited to conduct
  the visiting noble to Aphur's king. Under their escort Kyphallos moved
  through the corridors and across courts to where, in an audience-room of huge
  proportions, Jagdor sat in state. Here his guard of honor drew aside and left
  the prince standing alone as Jadgor rose.</p>

  <p>"Welcome Cathur, to such poor hospitality as is mine," said Aphur's
  king.</p>

  <p>"Hail Aphur," Kyphallos replied, bowing in the least degree. "Cathur sends
  greeting through me, his son."</p>

  <p>Jagdor descended a step of the dais on which he sat. He put out a hand.
  "Accept a seat beside me, son of Cathur, whose presence gladdens the eye," he
  went on.</p>

  <p>Kyphallos advanced, clasped palms with the Aphurian king, mounted the
  steps and seated himself on the gilded divan where Jadgor had sat alone.</p>

  <p>The king of Aphur turned to two guards stationed on either side. "Announce
  that Cathur is Aphur's guest."</p>

  <p>"Cathur is the guest of Aphur!" proclaimed the soldier heralds.</p>

  <p>This completed the ceremonial of the royal arrival and the nobles withdrew
  with the exception of Lakkon, who, at a sign from Jadgor, remained and
  approached the dais.</p>

  <p>Jadgor waved away his guards. "I would speak with you on matters of
  weight, O Cathur," he said when the three were alone.</p>

  <p>"I give ear. King of Aphur," Kyphallos replied.</p>

  <p>Like the man of purpose he was Jadgor did not waste time in airy
  persiflage.</p>

  <p>"Cathur guards the western gate with Aphur, Kyphallos," he began. "To my
  mind it occurs the guards are bound by a common interest. It occurs to me to
  strengthen the tie."</p>

  <p>"To what end?" A slight frown grew between the younger man's eyes. He
  seemed like one taken suddenly by surprise and his words came only after a
  perceptible pause.</p>

  <p>"To the end of strengthening our nation," Jadgor shot out his reply. "In
  one year Tamhys's reign is done, unless he be re- elected, as you know. With
  Cathur's help and that of Nodhur, which is well assured, and support from
  Milidhur already promised, Aphur can win the day."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Suddenly Kyphallos smiled. And as swiftly his eyelids drew together.
  "But what," he asked, "if Cathur should look toward Zitra as well?"</p>

  <p>Like a stab of light a thought pierced Croft's listening brain. Was that
  it&mdash;was that the bait Zollaria held forth? Kyphallos on the throne of
  Tamarizia&mdash;not for ten years, but for life&mdash; Zollaria and Tamarizia
  practically one if not actually united&mdash; Cathur in Zollaria's hands and
  Kyphallos a noble of a vast empire&mdash;a dual monarchy such as Palos had
  never seen. The conception from the stand-point of royalty at least was no
  less than magnificent.</p>

  <p>Jadgor, too, gave his companion a piercing glance. "Could Cathur win
  without Aphur?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Kyphallos shrugged. "My words were but a question," he evaded the answer
  direct. "What does Aphur propose?"</p>

  <p>"An alliance of their houses," Jadgor said and paused.</p>

  <p>And once more Kyphallos frowned without reply. Plainly he was giving this
  matter consideration.</p>

  <p>Jadgor resumed. "It is in our minds to offer you the fairest flower in
  Aphur's garden of women to this end."</p>

  <p>"Hai! A woman! Thou meanest marriage?" Kyphallos cried.</p>

  <p>"Aye."</p>

  <p>Kyphallos smiled. "And this wonderful woman&mdash;who is she?"</p>

  <p>"The daughter of Prince Lakkon here," Jadgor declared. "Naia, the child of
  my sister, more beautiful than any girl in Aphur and pure as the Virgin
  Ga."</p>

  <p>"Naia!" Kyphallos's eyes lighted. "I have heard of her, O Aphur. It would
  seem you plan to make this alliance strong."</p>

  <p>"The guard of the western gate should be strong," Jadgor said.</p>

  <p>Kyphallos nodded. "Yet have I never seen her," he remarked in a tone of
  musing, "though the fame of her beauty has reached Cathur ere this. I have
  heard she has hair like spun gold and eyes as purple as the twilight in the
  mountains. Is this true?"</p>

  <p>"Cathur shall judge the truth for himself," Jadgor made response. "Prince
  Lakkon craves the presence of Kyphallos at a feast to- morrow night. The
  maiden shall be there."</p>

  <p>"Good." Once more Kyphallos smiled. Women were his main interest in
  life.</p>

  <p>"I have never given serious thought to marriage, yet it can do no harm to
  see this fairest of Aphur's maids. Say to Prince Lakkon that Cathur shall do
  himself the pleasure to accept his invitation to a feast. As for the
  rest&mdash;" He shrugged. "A man, O Jadgor, should never marry in haste. I
  must think upon your words."</p>

  <p>There was something in the Cathurian's mind. Croft tried to read the
  secret thought, and failed. Jadgor, too, seemed to sense some reason beyond
  the one assigned for the man's hesitation, although an immediate answer was
  hardly to have been expected to such a proposition as that by which the
  prince was faced.</p>

  <p>And Jadgor did not seek to press the matter further. Instead, he turned to
  Lakkon with a request to escort the royal guest to the rooms prepared against
  his coming, and rose from his seat.</p>

  <p>CROFT sought Prince Lakkon's palace without more delay.</p>

  <p>He found it receiving the finishing touches of preparation for the
  Cathurian's entertainment, and Naia, with her own maid beside her,
  supervising the hangings of fresh draperies in the huge central court.</p>

  <p>His soul quickened at sight of her and then sank as he saw the expression
  on her face. It was an expression of deliberate endurance, and he recalled
  how nights before she had sighed in her sleep.</p>

  <p>Yet he hovered near her and, after hours Lakkon, himself arrived and came
  to her side. Father and daughter sat upon one of the carved and gilded seats
  with which the court had been set forth.</p>

  <p>Naia looked into Lakkon's eyes. "What said the Cathurian to Jadgor's
  proposal?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"He accepted our invitation for the night after this," Lakkon replied. "He
  seems a cautious man. He would see you before he decides."</p>

  <p>"He would see me!" Naia of Aphur flashed. "He would view me&mdash; learn
  if I please his royal fancy&mdash;Zitu! must I submit to this?"</p>

  <p>"Nay." Lakkon shook his head. "Cathur's prince was but gaining time to
  consider all sides of the case. Jadgor's offer took him by surprise."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Naia in almost eager fashion, "he does not wish a
  wife."</p>

  <p>Lakkon shook his head again. "Scythys, his father, is old. Kyphallos must
  marry when he gains the throne at latest. Is everything prepared?"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;even to&mdash;the sacrifice." Naia's tone was bitter. She rose
  and moved away without more words, mounting the stairs toward her rooms.</p>

  <p>Croft's heart was bitter, too, as he left the place and returned by his
  will to Scira and the apartment of Jasor of Nodhur.</p>

  <p>Just why he went there he hardly knew&mdash;save that the sympathy he felt
  for the soul-sick youth seemed to keep the boy in his mind. Yet once in his
  presence he found the youth sitting before an untouched plate of food. And
  after a time he hurled this to the floor and buried his head in his hands, to
  break into muttered speech.</p>

  <p>Croft listened and after a time he found the cause. Jasor's father had
  sent him word to come home. The two leaves of a writing tablet&mdash;bits of
  thin metal covered with hardened wax, in which characters were cut with a
  metal stylus, lay unbound and spread out on the table where the food had sat.
  Jasor's father had evidently become convinced that his son was a dullard and
  was wasting his time in seeking to learn more than he already knew.</p>

  <p>Croft remained with him during the night. For a time he whimpered and
  cursed. Later he destroyed the tablets as he had destroyed his food. After
  that he flung himself on his couch and for hours he dozed and waked and
  tossed and muttered. Croft fancied him in a fever from the broken nature of
  the words he spoke.</p>

  <p>And in the morning the boy did not rise. The woman of whom he rented his
  lodgings came to clean and found him muttering and mouthing. He sprang up and
  drove her from the room. She ran crying downstairs and out to the street and
  along it for some distance to a house where quite evidently one of the
  nursing caste lived.</p>

  <p>Presently a woman in the uniform of her calling, a short blue- skirted
  costume embroidered with a red, heart-shaped symbol came forth and followed
  her back to her house. Five minutes after her arrival she had sent the old
  woman for a doctor and was herself bathing Jasor's flushed neck and face.</p>

  <p>The doctor came, examined the patient, left some liquid substance to be
  given in interval doses and went away.</p>

  <p>Croft remained till evening. Jasor was more quiet by then, and he left.
  But, physician as he was, he felt that the young Nodhurian's days were
  numbered, that unless he had the will to recover he would sink slowly and die
  in the end. And he knew Jasor had not the will to get well.</p>

  <p>His own will carried him to Himyra in a flash, and to Lakkon's palace at
  once. Night had fallen when he reached it and the central court was a blaze
  of light from a myriad of oil-lamps. In the main expanse of the crystal
  flooring the tables were set forth, decked with flowers, and loaded with
  viands. Serving men and maidens of the blue Mazzerian race were still at work
  in the final preparations. Of Naia or Lakkon there was no sign.</p>

  <p>The latter came down the stairs at one end after some time, however, and
  signing to Bazka, the Mazzerian majordomo, took up a place near the massive
  doors. There he remained until a clatter of hoofs marked the first arriving
  guests.</p>

  <p>They came in a stream thereafter: nobles of Aphur and their daughters and
  wives, captains of the civic guard, and finally, with a blare of trumpets
  from riders mounted on gnuppas, Jadgor himself and Kyphallos in a golden
  coach drawn by eight gnuppas harnessed four abreast.</p>

  <p>And still Naia had not appeared.</p>

  <p>But as the King of Aphur and the Prince of Cathur moved down the crystal
  pave from the doors toward the tables in the center of the court, she came
  slowly down the stairs.</p>

  <p>Croft stared in delight. She was a thing of purple and gold. The gown she
  had described that first day wrapped her supple form like a second skin, from
  right shoulder to hip, and fell from there to the knees. It was a shimmering
  thing embroidered in purple stones.</p>

  <p>Halfway down the stairs she stood and inclined, her head, while Jadgor and
  Kyphallos paused. Then as the men advanced she began again to descend, until
  near the head of the tables she sank on her left knee and bowed before the
  king.</p>

  <p>Jadgor's own hand helped her to rise. Jadgor made Kyphallos known. Prince
  and princess touched hands. Lakkon led toward the feast.</p>

  <p>At the head sat Jadgor and Kyphallos side by side. Lakkon reclined beside
  the king. Naia's place was on the Prince of Cathur's left. Blue servants in
  Lakkon's livery placed the other guests and began their service at once.</p>

  <p>For an hour the feast went on. Hidden musicians filled the air with the
  sound of their harps. That snow-chilled wine, of which Lakkon had spoken,
  poured from golden pitchers into goblets of silver as serving-maids passed up
  and down the board to keep all well supplied.</p>

  <p>Croft noted Kyphallos more closely than the rest. He had seen the swift
  lighting of his eyes when Naia appeared on the stairs, the swift instinctive
  parting of his too full lips, the twitch of his nostrils, accompanying that
  first glance of the maid suggested for his wife.</p>

  <p>Now, as he lay on the divan, he found him watching her with what seemed a
  steady interest, plying her with gallant conversation, finding excuse to
  frequently touch her hands, staring into her long-lashed purple eyes. With
  his resentment for the Cathurian growing by swift leaps and bounds, he
  realized that Kyphallos was impressed, sensed that before this chaste beauty
  of his own people, he had forgotten Zollaria's magnet for the time. Also he
  thought it had been better had the wine been less nicely chilled, for
  Kyphallos drank deep and his eyes began to sparkle as time passed with new
  toasts proposed and drunk about the board. It came to Croft that Cathur's
  prince was losing his head at a time when he had better have kept it, as his
  voice became more and more loud.</p>

  <p>Intoxication may be very well on Anthra, where it was the accepted thing.
  In Himyra and the palace of Lakkon, before his proposed bride, it might prove
  another thing. He was strengthened in his belief by the questioning glance
  Naia cast at the northern noble from time to time&mdash;a glance of something
  like surprised dismay.</p>

  <p>The harps struck up a different measure toward the last. Golden curtains
  parted under the balcony near the stairs. A band of dancing girls trooped in.
  They were things of beauty, laughing- faced, their soft hair flowing, clad in
  what seemed no more than garlands of flowers twined about their slender
  bodies and half- way down their limbs. Beginning to dance they advanced and
  as they danced they sang. The scene became one of rhythmic beauty, delightful
  to the senses. Each girl bore a parti-colored veil of gauze and waved it as
  she moved. Massed inside the rectangle of the tables on the crystal floor,
  they seemed to be a very dancing, nodding bed of flowers, amid which twinkled
  their flying feet and gesturing arms, beating time to the' pulse of the
  harps.</p>

  <p>Then it was done. The dancers were drawing back with graceful
  genuflections, as applause broke forth from the guests. Lakkon tossed a
  handful of silver pieces among them. Jadgor cast a double handful of jewels
  into the scarf of a maid who advanced at his sign.</p>

  <p>"Divide them among you," he said. The girl sank to the floor, and
  rose.</p>

  <p>"Hold!" cried Cathur's prince. His face was flushed and his eyes shone
  with an unholy light. Croft saw his nostrils fairly quiver as he watched the
  lissom dancer. He lifted himself and struck the table. "Up!" he commanded
  thickly. "Up beauteous maid!"</p>

  <p>With a glance at Jadgor, who made no sign whatever, the dancing girl
  obeyed. She stood on the table before Kyphallos.</p>

  <p>"Unveil!" he said.</p>

  <p>Again the woman glanced at Aphur's king. But Jadgor did not draw back from
  the situation invoked by his bibulous guest. Too much hung on the moment as
  Jadgor saw it to quibble over the uncloaking of a dancer. "Unveil!" he added
  his command.</p>

  <p>The girl lifted her hands. Her garlands fell away. She stood a lithely
  rounded form, her feet lost in the mass of blossoms she had worn.</p>

  <p>Kyphallos laughed. His eyes were blazing. He caught up a goblet of wine
  and rose.</p>

  <p>"Hail Adita, goddess of womanly beauty," he exclaimed. "Now, are you
  perfect as you stand revealed, stripped of the silly trappings which
  concealed the greater charms beneath. Flowers are things of beauty in their
  place, but woman unadorned is the fairest flower of life. Arise, my friends,
  and drink with me to woman as she is, this new Adita I have found!"</p>

  <p>They rose at Jadgor's sign, though Croft caught more than one glance of
  question passing among the guests. So much he saw and turned back to Naia who
  had risen, too, her face a mask of outraged dignity and scorn.</p>

  <p>Kyphallos lifted his goblet and set it to his lips.</p>

  <p>Naia lifted hers and cast it from her so that its contents spilled and
  flowed across the table at the dancer's feet.</p>

  <p>"Thou beast!" her voice came in tones of sharp displeasure. "Thou sensuous
  offspring of Cathur! 'Tis thus I drink your toast!"</p><a id="pic2"
        name="pic2"></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0801081h-images/Palos-2.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration"> x
  </div><br>

  <p>Silence came down&mdash;a breathless pause about the tables.</p>

  <p>Kyphallos lowered his cup and turned toward the Princess of Aphur slowly.
  And suddenly the Cathurian smiled. He replaced his goblet on the table and
  sank to one knee before the haughty daughter of his host.</p>

  <p>"By Zitu!" his voice rang out; "but you are truly royal. You are
  magnificent, daughter of Aphur. Did I pick me a lesser toy, 'twas but that I
  knew you for what you are&mdash;one fit to be a queen. Naia of Aphur, wilt
  pledge yourself queen of Cathur's throne?"</p>

  <p>The words were out. Croft felt his senses sink. Yet even so he saw the
  whole psychology of the event. To Cathur, the maiden offered, had seemed but
  an easy prize&mdash;to take at his pleasure, if at all. To Cathur drunk the
  dance had appealed. To Cathur still drunk Naia of Aphur, offended, angered,
  hurling her scorn an his teeth, appeared suddenly not a thing to be taken
  lightly, but a beautiful consort to be won if taken at all.</p>

  <p>On Jadgor's face was a satisfaction unvoiced, He rose and lifted his
  hands.</p>

  <p>"My lords and ladies," he announced, "I call you to witness that Cathur
  asks the hand of Aphur's princess. Let Naia choose."</p>

  <p>Kyphallos drew himself up and folded his arms. To Croft it seemed the man
  was sobered by Jadgor's words. Yet as cries of assent and acclamation rang
  out through the court, he remained silent before the tense figure of the
  girl.</p>

  <p>And slowly the golden head beneath the curling plume of purple bowed. One
  bared arm rose and extended its fingers toward the northern prince.</p>

  <p>"Aphur accepts."</p>

  <p>Her words came scarcely above a whisper and were drowned in a greeting
  roar of voices upraised by the waiting guests.</p>

  <p>Cathur caught the extended hand and turned to the forward- straining
  faces, the watching eyes.</p>

  <p>"A happy consummation to our feast," rang the words of Aphur's king. "Men
  and women of Aphur this shall be arranged. I, Jadgor, myself shall sponsor
  the formal betrothal on a day one twelfth of a cycle hence."</p>

  <p>The thing was done. A month from to-night would see it ratified. A sick
  impotency filled Croft's soul as once more cries of approbation greeted the
  promise of the king. And into the midst of his despair there flashed one ray
  of blinding thought. Before it he staggered, drew back, shaken in the primal
  elements of his being. Yet he did not put it aside. He held it. He marveled
  at it. And suddenly taking it with him, he left the scented atmosphere of
  Lakkon's palace court and rose up toward the heavens, studded with stars.</p>

  <p>To earth! His will gathered, centered, focused by the wonder of the thing
  he had conceived, cast all its driving power into the demand. Palos and all
  it held sank swiftly away beneath him. He opened the eyes of the form he left
  on his library couch.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">IX. &mdash; 'TWIXT EARTH AND HEAVEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NOTHING had been disturbed. Everything was as he had last
  seen it, save that a layer of dust had collected, thanks to the absence of
  Mrs. Goss, and that due to the difference of the length of the Palosian day.
  Nine terrestrial days had passed since Croft had lain his body on the
  couch.</p>

  <p>Rising slowly, he ignited the flame of a small alcohol-lamp and quickly
  brewed himself a cup of strong beef-extract, which he drank. The hot beverage
  and the food put new physical life into his sluggish veins, as he knew it
  would.</p>

  <p>Seating himself in a chair, he gave himself over to a consideration of the
  thought he had brought with him from Palos&mdash;a thought more weird than
  any of which he had ever dreamed.</p>

  <p>Briefly, Croft had conceived of a way to acquire a physical life on Palos.
  That was his unheard-of plan, the possibility of which had wakened in his
  consciousness as Jadgor announced the formal betrothal of Naia to Kyphallos
  at the end of the month. It was that that had sent him back here to his study
  and his books.</p>

  <p>And after a bit he rose and drew a volume from a case and brought it back
  to the desk. It was a work dealing with obsessions&mdash;that theory of the
  occultist that a stronger spirit might displace the weaker tenant of an
  earthly shell, and occupy, and dominate the body it had possessed.</p>

  <p>He read over the written page and sat pondering once more while the night
  dragged past. Even as he had gone a step farther in astral projection,
  carrying it into spirit projection as a further step, so now he was
  considering a step beyond mere obsession and questioning whether or not it
  were possible for a spirit, potent beyond the average ego of earth, to enter
  and revivify the body laid down by another soul.</p>

  <p>His thoughts were of Jasor as he sat, there wrapped in thought. The young
  Nodhurian was dying, unless Croft's medical knowledge was all at fault. Yet
  he was dying not from disease in the physical sense. His body was organically
  healthy. It was his soul which was sick unto death. And&mdash;here was the
  wonderful question: Could Croft's strong spirit enter Jasor's body as Jasor
  laid it aside and, operating on the still inherent and reasonably sound
  cell-energy still contained within it, possess it for its own?</p>

  <p>It was an amazing thought&mdash;a daring thought&mdash;yet not so far
  beyond the spirit which had dared the emptiness of the unknown in the
  adventure which had brought Croft to his present position, thereby inspiring
  the thought itself. Day broke, however, before Croft made up his mind.</p>

  <p>He realized fully that he must remain on earth for a day or two to provide
  his present body against another period of trance. He realized also that in
  the experiment he meant to make he might lose that earthly body and fail in
  his other attempt at one and the same time. But he made up his mind none the
  less. Should he succeed, he would live as an inhabitant of Palos&mdash;would
  be able to physically stand between Naia&mdash;the one woman of his
  soul&mdash;and her fate&mdash;and, winning, be able perhaps to claim her for
  himself. Against the possibility of such a consummation to his great
  adventure no argument of a personal peril held weight.</p>

  <p>Croft sent for Mrs. Goss, telegraphing her shortly after it was light. He
  spent the day waiting her arrival in feeding his body with concentrated
  foods. He met her when she came, and for a week life went on in the Croft
  house as it had gone on before. Then Croft summoned the little woman and
  bade, her sit down in one of the library chairs.</p>

  <p>He told her he was engaged on a wonderful investigation of the forces of
  life. He made her understand dimly he was doing something never attempted
  before, which, if it succeeded, would make him very happy. He explained that
  he was about to take a long sleep&mdash;that it would last for three, and
  possibly four days. He forbade her to disturb his body during that time, or
  to touch it for a week.</p>

  <p>Then, if he was not returned and in his sane mind, she might know that he
  was dead.</p>

  <p>With quivering lips and wide eyes and apron-plucking hands, she promised
  to obey. Croft sensed her anxiety for himself, and tried to be very gentle as
  he saw her from the room. But with the door closed behind her, he moved
  quickly to the couch and stretched himself out. For a moment he lay staring
  about the familiar room. Then into his mind there came a thought of
  Naia&mdash;and of Jasor&mdash;of love for the one and pity for the other. He
  smiled and fastened his mind on the object of this present attempt. And
  suddenly his eyelids closed and his body relaxed. Once more time and space
  suffered annihilation, and he knew himself in Jasor's room.</p>

  <p>It was full. The nurse was there, and the physician. And there was
  another&mdash;a young man with a strong, composed face, clad in a tunic of
  unembroidered brown, whom Croft recognized as a priest.</p>

  <p>He stood by the couch on which Jasor lay, pallid as wax, with closed lids,
  and a barely perceptible respiration. He held a silver basin in his hands,
  and as Croft watched he sprinkled the face of the dying youth with his
  fingers dipped in the water it contained. A quiver of emotion shook Croft's
  spirit. He had returned to Palos none too soon. The priest drew back. The
  doctor approached the bed. He lifted the wrist of Jasor and set his fingers
  to the pulse. In a moment he laid it down, and bowed his head. And as he did
  so, Jasor sighed once deeply like one very tired.</p>

  <p>"He passes," the physician said.</p>

  <p>Priest, nurse, and physician all saw it. But Croft saw more than they. He
  saw the astral form, the soul-body of Jasor, rise from the discarded clay.
  And, swiftly casting aside all other considerations, he willed his own
  consciousness into the vacant brain.</p>

  <p>Thereafter followed an experience, the most terrible he had ever known. He
  was within Jasor's body, yet he was chained. For what seemed hours he fought
  to control the physical elements of the fleshy form he had seized. And always
  he failed. In some indefinable way it seemed to resist the new tenant who had
  taken the place of the old. Croft describes his own sensations as those of
  one who presses against and seeks to move an immovable weight. He
  suffered&mdash;suffered until the very suffering broke down the bonds in a
  demand for some outward expression. Then, and only then he knew that the
  chest of the body had once more moved, and that he had drawn air into the
  lungs. Encouraged, he exerted his staggering will afresh, and he knew he was
  looking into the faces above him&mdash;through Jasor's physical eyes!</p>

  <p>"He lives!"</p>

  <p>With Jasor's ears he heard the physician exclaim:</p>

  <p>"This passes understanding, man of Zitu. He was dead, yet now he lives
  again!"</p>

  <p>"The ways of Zitu oft pass the understanding, man of healing," said the
  priest, advancing to the bed. "What is man to understand the things that Zitu
  plans?"</p>

  <p>Croft thrilled. Coordination between his conscious spirit and the body of
  the man of Palos was established. He had won again&mdash;won a visible,
  material existence on the planet with the woman he loved. The thought brought
  a sense of absolute satisfaction. He closed the lids above Jasor's eyes, and
  slept.</p>

  <p>For several hours he lay in restful slumber, then awoke refreshed. His
  deductions had been correct. Jasor's body was healthy, aside from the
  weakening influences of his spirit. Given a strong spirit to dominate it now,
  and it responded in full tide.</p>

  <p>He glanced about. It was night. By the dim light of an oil-lamp he saw two
  persons in the room. One was the nurse. The other was the priest. They
  appeared to converse in lowered tones.</p>

  <p>"Man of Zitu," Croft spoke for the first time with his new-found
  tongue.</p>

  <p>The priest rose and hurried to him.</p>

  <p>"My son."</p>

  <p>"I am much improved," said Croft. "In the morning I shall be almost wholly
  well."</p>

  <p>"It is a miracle," the priest declared, holding his forearms horizontally
  before him until he made a perfect cross.</p>

  <p>A miracle! Croft considered the words. They carried a sudden meaning to
  his mind. Truly the priest had spoken rightly. This was little short of a
  miracle indeed, did the other know the facts.</p>

  <p>Swiftly Croft formed a plan. "Father, what is your name?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Abbu, my son."</p>

  <p>Croft turned his eyes. "Send the nurse away. I would talk with you
  alone."</p>

  <p>The priest spoke to the woman, who withdrew slowly, her face a mingled
  mask of emotions, chief among which Croft read a sort of awed wonder.</p>

  <p>"Why does she look at me like that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The priest seated himself on a stool beside the couch. "I said your
  recovery was a miracle, my son," he replied. "I am minded that I told the
  truth. You have changed, even your face has changed while you slept. You are
  not the same."</p>

  <p>Croft felt his muscles stiffen. He understood. The new spirit was molding
  the fleshy elements to itself&mdash;uniting itself to them, knitting soul and
  body together. The experiment was a success.</p>

  <p>He smiled. "That is true. Father Abbu," he replied. "I am not the same as
  the Jasor who died."</p>

  <p>"Died?" The priest drew back. His eyes widened.</p>

  <p>"Died," repeated Croft. "Listen, father. These things must be in
  confidence."</p>

  <p>"Aye," Abbu agreed.</p>

  <p>Croft told what had occurred.</p>

  <p>Abbu heard him out. At the end he was seized by a shaking which caused him
  to quiver through body and limbs.</p>

  <p>"Listen, father," Croft said. "I am not Jasor, though I inhabit his form.
  Yet I know something of him, and of Tamarizia as well. Jasor had a
  father."</p>

  <p>"And a mother." The priest inclined his head.</p>

  <p>Croft had gained information, but he did not make a comment upon it
  then.</p>

  <p>"To them I must appear still as Jasor," he returned.</p>

  <p>"They are looked for in Scira," Abbu declared. "We hoped for their coming.
  Why have you done this thing? Are you good or evil?"</p>

  <p>"Good, by the grace of Zitu," said Croft. "I come to help Tamarizia. Think
  you I could have come had not Zitu willed?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly the face of the young priest flamed. "Nay!" he cried, and rose to
  stand by the couch. "Now my eyes are open and I see. This thing is of Zitu,
  nor could be save by his will. It is, as I said, a miracle indeed." Again he
  lifted his arms in the sign of the cross.</p>

  <p>"Then," said Croft, striking quickly while the man was lost in the grip of
  religious fervor. "Wilt thou help me to do that for which I came&mdash;wilt
  thou help me to help Tamarizia should the need arise?"</p>

  <p>"Aye."</p>

  <p>To his surprise Abbu sank before him on bended knees.</p>

  <p>"How am I to serve him who comes at the behest of Zitu in so miraculous a
  way?"</p>

  <p>"Call me Jasor as in the past," decided Croft. The name was near enough to
  his own to fit easily into both his ears and mouth. "Yet think me not Jasor,"
  he went on. "Jasor was a dullard, weak in his brain. Soon shall I show you
  things such as you have never dreamed. Think you I am Jasor or another
  indeed?"</p>

  <p>"You are not Jasor," said the priest.</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;by Zitu himself, I swear it," said Croft. "Go now and send back
  the nurse. Say nothing of what I have told you. Swear silence by Zitu, and
  come to me every day."</p>

  <p>"I swear," Abbu promised, rising, "and&mdash;I shall come, O Spirit sent
  by Zitu." He left the room backward and with bowed head.</p>

  <p>Croft let every cell of his new body relax and stretched out. He closed
  his eyes as he heard the nurse return, and gave himself up to thought. It
  appeared to him that he had made a very good beginning and won an ally in
  Abbu, into whose astonishment he had woven a thread of the man's own religion
  to strengthen his belief. Now it remained to gain utter control of the body
  he possessed&mdash;to master it completely, and make it not only responsive
  to his physical use, but to so impregnate it with his own essence that he
  might leave it&mdash;for short times at least&mdash;in order to return to the
  earth.</p>

  <p>And to accomplish that he had just four days. Lying there apparently
  asleep, he sought to exercise that control he possessed over the body now
  lying on his library couch. And he failed. Strive as he might, he could not
  compass success. In something like a panic he desisted after a time and
  sought to fight back, to a balanced mental calm.</p>

  <p>Was he trapped? he asked himself. Was he a prisoner of the thing he had
  sought to make his own? Reason told him the question was folly&mdash;that
  already the body was responding in a physical sense. In the end he decided to
  take a longer time in his endeavors, and so at last fell into a genuine
  sleep.</p>

  <p>From that he awakened to the sound of voices, and turned his eyes to
  behold a woman past middle age, with graying hair, and a man, strongly built,
  with a well-featured face, in the room.</p>

  <p>Waking swiftly, his mind recalled Abbu's words concerning Jasor's parents.
  The priest had said they were expected in Scira. This woman, then, must be
  the Nodhurian's mother.</p>

  <p>He opened his lips and called her by that word.</p>

  <p>She ran to him and sank her knees by the couch.</p>

  <p>"Jasor, my son!" she cried in a voice which quavered, and as the man
  approached more slowly, turned her face upward to meet his eyes. "He knows
  me, Sinon&mdash;he knows me," she said.</p>

  <p>"Aye, Mellia, praise be to Zitu. Jasor, my son, dost know me also?" the
  Nodhurian's father said.</p>

  <p>"Aye, sir," said Croft, marking his parents' names. "But&mdash;how come
  you in Scira?"</p>

  <p>"Did we not write that we should arrive and take you with us on our
  return?" Sinon asked.</p>

  <p>Croft saw it in a flash, and the slip he had made. This explained Abbu's
  assertion that they were expected. The tablets hurled to the floor by Jasor
  had been deciphered after his illness, it appeared.</p>

  <p>"Aye," he admitted somewhat faintly. "But&mdash;I have been ill."</p>

  <p>"And are recovered now," he who was to be his father said.</p>

  <p>"Aye. Had I my clothing I could rise."</p>

  <p>"We shall return then at once," Sinon declared.</p>

  <p>But Mellia, the mother, broke into protests, and Croft became much more
  cautious, spoke for delay. He did not wish to undertake a trip to Nodhur
  before he had returned to earth. That was necessary if he was to protect his
  earth body from Mrs. Goss at the end of the week, since now he knew he must
  have more time.</p>

  <p>He determined to make another attempt at escape from his new body, when he
  would appear merely to be asleep. And he succeeded late that night, freeing
  himself and once more rousing on the library couch. He did several things at
  once. He examined his own body and found it sound. He wrote a note telling
  his housekeeper he had returned and gone away for at least a month. He knew
  many a body had been kept entranced for longer periods by the Indian adepts
  of the East, so did not fear the attempt.</p>

  <p>Next he crept upstairs to his former bedroom and packed a suitcase,
  carrying it to one of the several spare rooms, seldom used and always kept
  closed. Locking himself into this room, he opened the window slightly to
  assure a supply of air.</p>

  <p>He had told Mrs. Goss to remain at the house or go to her daughter's, as
  she preferred, until his return. He felt assured he would be undisturbed.</p>

  <p>Laying himself on the bed, he once more satisfied himself that all was as
  he wished it, and returned to Jasor's room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">X. &mdash; WHOM ZITU CHANGED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DAWN was breaking on Palos as he opened his eyes. The nurse
  dozed not far from his couch. He waked her and demanded his clothing. She
  brought it in some doubt and assisted him to put it on. Ten minutes later he
  sat on the edge of the couch&mdash;a Palosian in all physical seeming. Yet
  the woman regarded him still in a more or less uncertain fashion.</p>

  <p>Croft smiled. "Thank you for your kindness, my nurse," he said. "I shall
  ask my father to remunerate you for it. Now I would eat."</p>

  <p>She nodded and hurried from the room, to return with food. Hardly had
  Croft disposed of the meal with a zest evoked of his physical needs, than
  Sinon of Nodhur appeared.</p>

  <p>Croft rose and stood as the man came in.</p>

  <p>"We return home to-day, my father," he declared.</p>

  <p>Sinon seemed embarrassed before the words of his son. "Aye, if you wish,"
  he made answer after a pause. "Sit you, my son. We must speak together. Your
  sickness has wrought changes within you. You are not the Jasor to whom I
  wrote it were useless to remain in Scira. The glance of your eye, the sound
  of your voice, even the lines of your face, have changed."</p>

  <p>Croft smiled. "That is true," he agreed. "Yet even so it is of small value
  to remain in Scira, since now I know all and more than the learned men can
  teach me, were I to linger among them for many more cycles than I have."</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" Sinon regarded him oddly. "My son, is this change to make you a
  braggart instead of a dullard?" he began slowly after a time.</p>

  <p>"Not so," Croft returned. "My father, I am as one born anew. I shall prove
  my words, yet not until I have returned to our home. Let us begin the journey
  this day."</p>

  <p>"It shall be as you wish," Sinon said, and left the room.</p>

  <p>Later Abbu came and was admitted. To him Croft explained that he was going
  south to Nodhur with his father. He went further and questioned the priest
  concerning Sinon himself, learning that he was a wealthy merchant, residing
  in Ladhra, capital of the southern state.</p>

  <p>The information was a considerable shock to Croft. The merchant caste,
  while exercising great influence and weight in Tamarizian affairs, were not
  of noble blood. Hence now, at the very beginning he found himself confronted
  by a gulf of caste separating him from Naia of Aphur hardly less completely
  than before he had made Jasor's body his own. For a moment the thought
  occurred to him that he had chosen that body rather badly. Then his natural
  determination came to his aid, and he set his lips as he resolved to find a
  way to win to Naia's side.</p>

  <p>Abbu rather drew back before the gleam which crept into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Jasor, since I know you by no other name," he cried, "wherein have I
  given offense?"</p>

  <p>Croft laughed. He rose and flexed his arms and stared into Abbu's face.
  "In nothing; I was but thinking," he made answer. "Abbu, give me tablets to
  the priesthood at Himyra, stating those things you have seen."</p>

  <p>Abbu nodded. "You stop at Himyra?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Aye."</p>

  <p>The first step of winning to the woman of his soul flashed into Croft's
  brain, even as his plan for winning a body had flashed there days before. But
  he kept it to himself, locked safely in his breast, as he set forth for his
  new home, with his parents, Sinon and Mellia, that afternoon.</p>

  <p>That Sinon of Nodhur was wealthy he was assured when he saw the galley in
  which the homeward journey was to be made. It was a swift craft, gilded and
  ornate as to hull and masts and spars. Ten rowers furnished power on its two
  banks of oars, seated on the benches in the waist of the hull. Behind them
  were the cabin and a deck under an awning of the silk-like fabric, a
  brilliant green in hue. Not only did all this show Croft his supposed
  father's financial condition, but he learned from Sinon that he was owner of
  a fleet of merchant craft which plied up and down the Na, and across the
  Central Sea. In addition, the largesse Sinon bestowed on the nurse was
  evidence of a well-filled purse.</p>

  <p>All these things Croft considered in the intervals of conversation with
  Sinon and Mellia while the galley ran south. In his boyhood Jason had been
  possessed of a natural aptitude for mechanics. In later manhood he had owned
  and operated his own automobiles, making most of the repairs upon the cars
  himself. Learning now of his father's line of business, it occurred to him to
  revolutionize transportation on Palos as a first step toward making his name
  a word familiar to every tongue.</p>

  <p>To this end he approached Sinon the first evening as he and Mellia
  reclined on the deck.</p>

  <p>"My father," he said, "what if the trip to Ladhra could be shortened by
  half?"</p>

  <p>"Shortened, in what fashion?" Sinon asked, turning a swift glance toward
  Croft.</p>

  <p>"By increasing the speed."</p>

  <p>Sinon smiled; "The galley is the best product of our builders," he
  replied.</p>

  <p>"Granted," said Croft. "But were one to place a device upon it to do the
  work of the rowers with ten times their strength?"</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" Sinon lifted himself on his couch. "What, Jasor, is this? What
  mean you, my-son? What is this device?"</p>

  <p>"One I have in mind," Croft told him. "Come. You make your money with
  ships. Apply some of it to making them more swift of motion. Let me make this
  device, and they shall mount the Na more swiftly than now they run with the
  current and the wind."</p>

  <p>Sinon turned his eyes to the woman at his side. "And this is our son, who
  was a dullard!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"In whom I always have had faith," Mellia replied with a smile of maternal
  joy on her face.</p>

  <p>"You have faith in this thing he proposes?" Sinon went on.</p>

  <p>"Aye. I think Zitu himself spoke to him in his deathlike sleep," the woman
  said.</p>

  <p>"Then, by Zitu&mdash;he shall make the attempt!" Sinon roared. "Should he
  succeed, the king himself would make him a knight for his service to the
  state."</p>

  <p>Croft's heart leaped and ran racing for a minute at the words. Knighthood!
  That was the answer to the question in his brain&mdash;the bridge which
  should cross the gulf between Naia of Aphur and himself. He crushed back his
  emotions, however, and faced Sinon again. "Then I may carry out my plan?"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;to the half of my wealth," Sinon declared. "Jasor, I do not
  understand the change which has come upon you. But this thing you may do if
  you can."</p>

  <p>"Then we stop at Himyra," Croft announced.</p>

  <p>"At Himyra!" Sinon stared.</p>

  <p>"Aye. I would see Jadgor of Aphur so quickly as I may."</p>

  <p>"See Jadgor? You?" Sinon protested. "Think you Jadgor receives men of our
  caste without good cause?"</p>

  <p>"He will see Jasor of Nodhur," Croft told him with a smile. "Wait, my
  father? and you shall witness that, and more."</p>

  <p>And now all doubt, all foreboding left him, and he planned. That night as
  he lay in his bunk aboard the galley, he smiled. To him it seemed that any
  doubt must have been transferred to the minds of Sinon and Mellia. He heard
  them speaking above the lap of the waters and the squeak of the oars. He
  realized how much of an enigma he had become to these two who believed
  themselves his parents&mdash;how wonderful to them must be the change in
  their son.</p>

  <p>But his own mind was coolly collected and calm. He would see Jadgor. He
  would use his knowledge of that monarch's present wishes to interest him in
  his plans. He would become not a knight of Nodhur, but a knight of Aphur
  instead. And then&mdash;then&mdash;Croft smiled and fell asleep.</p>

  <p>The next day he questioned Sinon concerning the nature of the oil used in
  the lamps, and found it a vegetable product, as he had feared. But&mdash;he
  had been given evidence that the wine supply of the country held no small
  alcoholic content, which could be recovered in pure form with comparative
  ease. And&mdash;he knew enough of motors to know that slight changes would
  enable them to burn alcohol in lieu of petroleum-gas. Straightway he asked
  for something on which to draft his plans.</p>

  <p>Sinon, eager now in the development of his son's remarkable plan,
  furnished parchment and brushes with a square of color, something like India
  ink, and Croft set to work during the remainder of the trip. He had assembled
  more than one motor in his day, and after deciding upon his type of
  construction he immediately went to work. At the end of four days, while the
  galley was mounting the Na toward the gates of Himyra, he finished the first
  drafting of parts, and was ready for Jadgor the king. Yet he did not go to
  Jadgor first, when once he has stepped ashore.</p>

  <p>"Wait here," he requested Sinon. "After a time I shall return."</p>

  <p>"Hold, my son," Sinon objected at once.</p>

  <p>"What have you in mind?"</p>

  <p>"To see the priest of Zitu without delay," Croft replied without evasion.
  "Shall Jadgor not give ear, if the priest of Zitu asks?"</p>

  <p>"And the priest?" Sinon asked.</p>

  <p>"I carry a message to him from Abbu of Scira." Croft held up the tablets
  that Abbu had inscribed.</p>

  <p>"My son," Sinon gave him a glance of admiration. "Go, and Zitu go with
  you. We shall wait for you here."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded and left. He had purposely had the galley moored as near the
  palace as he might. Now he rapidly made his way to the bridge across the Na,
  and along it to the middle span. And there he paused and gazed about him at
  the palace, the pyramid, the vista of the terraced stream. This was
  Himyra&mdash;this was the home of Naia. Today he stood here unheralded and
  unknown. Yet he stood there because of the dominant spirit which was his,
  which had dared all to stand there, and it should not be long until all
  Himyra&mdash;all Tamarizia&mdash;knew of Jasor of Nodhur, as he surely must
  be known.</p>

  <p>He went on across the bridge and approached the pyramid. It lifted its
  vast pile above him. He found an inclined way and began to mount. After a
  considerable time he reached the top and entered the temple itself. The huge
  statue of Zitu sat there as he had seen it in his former state. Now almost
  without volition he bent his knees before it. After all, it stood for the One
  Eternal Source. He gave it reverence as such.</p>

  <p>A voice spoke to him as he knelt. He rose and confronted a priest.</p>

  <p>"Who art thou?" the latter asked, advancing toward him. "How come you here
  at no hour appointed for prayer?"</p>

  <p>Croft smiled and held forth the tablets he had brought.</p>

  <p>The priest took them, unbound them, and looked at the salutation. His
  interest quickened. "Ye come from Scira?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Aye. Carrying these tablets from the good Abbu, as you see."</p>

  <p>The priest considered. "Come," he said again at last, and led the way back
  of the statue to the head of a descending stair.</p>

  <p>Together they went down, along the worn tread of stone steps, turning here
  and there, until at length they came into a lofty apartment where sat a man
  in robes of an azure blue. Before him Croft's guide bowed.</p>

  <p>"Thy pardon, Magur, Priest of Zitu," he spoke, still in his stilted formal
  way. "But one comes carrying tablets inscribed with thy name. Even now he
  knelt in the Holy Place, so that I questioned&mdash;asking what he
  sought."</p>

  <p>Magur, high priest in Himyra, at least as Croft judged, took the tablets
  and scanned each leaf. As he read, his expression altered, grew at first
  well-nigh startled, and after that nothing short of amazed.</p>

  <p>In the end he waved the lay brother from the room and faced Croft
  alone.</p>

  <p>"Thou art called how?" he began.</p>

  <p>"Jasor of Nodhur&mdash;son of Sinon and Mellia of Nodhur," Croft
  replied.</p>

  <p>"Whom, Abbu writes, Zitu hath changed?"</p>

  <p>"Aye."</p>

  <p>"Thou comest to Himyra, why?"</p>

  <p>"To assist the State&mdash;to safeguard Tamarizia from the designs of
  Zollaria perhaps."</p>

  <p>"Hold!" Magur cried. "What know ye of Zollaria's plans?"</p>

  <p>"Zollaria desires Cathur and plots the downfall of Tamarizia, Priest of
  Zitu. Think you that I bring no knowledge to my task?"</p>

  <p>"Yet, were you Jasor indeed, thou mightest know somewhat of Zollaria's
  plans to some extent," said the priest.</p>

  <p>"And Jasor was a dullard, as the schools of Scira will declare," Croft
  flashed back. "Let my works show whether I stand a fool or not."</p>

  <p>"Thy works?" Magur inquired.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;those I shall do in Tamarizia's name. The first shall be one
  which shall span the desert twenty times as quickly as the sarpelca
  caravan&mdash;or drive a boat without sails or oars, or propel a carriage
  without any gnuppa, and so haul ten times the load."</p>

  <p>"Thou canst do this?" Magur laid the tablets on the lap of his robe and
  sat staring at the man who spoke such words.</p>

  <p>"Aye."</p>

  <p>"And what do you desire of me?"</p>

  <p>"An audience with Jadgor," Croft replied: "Since Aphur's king suspects the
  things Zollaria plans."</p>

  <p>Magur frowned. Croft's knowledge seemed to have swept him somewhat off his
  feet. For moments he sat without motion or sound. But after a time he raised
  his head. "To me Abbu seemeth right in this," he said. "In this Zitu's hand
  is. This thing shall be arranged."</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands. A brown-robed priest appeared.</p>

  <p>"Prepare my chariot for use," the high priest said.</p>

  <p>The other bowed and withdrew.</p>

  <p>Thereafter Magur sat through another period of silence ere he rose and,
  signing to Croft, led him through a passage to a small metal platform-which,
  when Magur pulled on a slender cord, began to de-scend. Croft smiled. It was
  a primitive sort of elevator as he saw while they sank down a narrow shaft.
  He fancied it not unlike the ancient lifts employed in Nero's palace in Rome.
  But he made no comment as they reached the bottom of the shaft and emerged
  past double lines of bowing priests to the waiting chariot. Magur mounted and
  took the reins.</p>

  <p>Croft stepped into a place at his side. The gnuppas leaped forward at a
  word.</p>

  <p>They rumbled down the street and out upon the bridge. Croft had crossed it
  alone and on foot an hour before. Now he rode back in the car of Zitu's
  priest.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">XI. &mdash; WITH A MOTOR IN PALOS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AND in that car he passed the palace gates, where the winged
  dogs stood guard, and entered the palace court. Guards in burnished cuirasses
  leaped to the gnuppas' heads when Magur drew rein.</p>

  <p>Inclining his head, Magur stepped from his car and led the way within that
  wing of the palace where Croft already knew that Jadgor led his private life.
  The high priest moved as of perfect right, saluted by a sentry here and there
  in corridor and hall. So at length he came to two guardsmen posted outside a
  door of molded copper, embossed with the symbol of a setting sun, which Croft
  sensed at once as Aphur's sign.</p>

  <p>And here Magur asked for the king. Quitting his fellow, one of the
  guardsmen disappeared through the door, was absent for some few moments, and
  returned. Leaving the door agape behind him, he signed Magur and Croft to
  enter the room beyond.</p>

  <p>Thus for the third time Croft came upon Jadgor of Aphur. And now, as on
  the first occasion, he found him in the room where he had conversed with
  Lakkon concerning a way to counter Zollaria's plans. Yet now for the first
  time he met Aphur's ruler in the flesh, and faced him man to man.</p>

  <p>Magur approached the seat where Jadgor waited his coming.</p>

  <p>"King of Aphur," he said. "I bring with me Jasor of Nodhur, in whom Zitu
  himself has worked a miracle, as it seems, so that he who was known a dull
  wit for cycles at Scira's school, having fallen ill unto death, returns to
  life with a changed mind, and comes bringing tablets to me from a brother in
  Scira to the end that I gain him audience with thee."</p>

  <p>"With me," Jadgor' said, bending a glance at Croft.</p>

  <p>"Aye."</p>

  <p>Jadgor continued to study Croft. "To what end?" he inquired at length.</p>

  <p>"To the end that Himyra and all Aphur may grow strong beyond any
  Tamarizian dream, and Cathur never mount the throne at Zitra," Croft
  replied.</p>

  <p>Jadgor started. He narrowed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"What talk is this?" he cried, his strong hand gripping the edge of his
  seat.</p>

  <p>"Jadgor the king knows best in his heart," said Croft, and waited. "I ask
  but his aid to bring this thing to pass."</p>

  <p>"These things have been spoken to Magur?" Jadgor turned his eyes to the
  face of the priest.</p>

  <p>"Aye," Croft said quickly.</p>

  <p>Jadgor nodded. "Then speak of them to me."</p>

  <p>An hour passed while Croft explained and the two Tamarizians listened or
  bent above the drawings he unrolled.</p>

  <p>"And this&mdash;how do you name it&mdash;" Jadgor began at last.</p>

  <p>"Motur." Croft threw the word into the native speech.</p>

  <p>"This motur will do these things?" Jadgor asked in a tone of amaze.</p>

  <p>"All I have promised, and more."</p>

  <p>"And what is required to bring this to pass?"</p>

  <p>"Workers in metals&mdash;a supply of wine to be used as I shall
  direct&mdash;and a closed mouth that Cathur shall not be adviced, nor
  permitted to view the work until done."</p>

  <p>"Those things are granted. I shall see it arranged." Jadgor turned his
  eyes again in Magur's direction. "Priest of Zitu, Zitu's own hand appears in
  the plans of Jasor's mind. The designs of Zitu himself have surely entered
  his soul. I, Jadgor, shall sponsor the carrying out."</p>

  <p>And once more, he addressed Croft.</p>

  <p>"When shall this work begin?"</p>

  <p>"So soon as Aphur wills."</p>

  <p>"Good." Jadgor clapped his hands. He was a man of action as Croft knew,
  quick to see an opportunity and seize it. Now as a guardsman answered the
  summons, he spoke quickly in direction.</p>

  <p>"Make search for my son, Prince Robur, and say I desire him here."</p>

  <p>The soldier withdrew, and Jadgor plunged into further questions concerning
  Croft's plans. Croft on his part answered him fully, promising other wonders
  than the motor in good time, until a faint tinge of color crept into Jadgor's
  cheeks and his eyes were aglint with a deep and subtle light. Croft would not
  doubt but that he saw Aphur dominating all the nation, that he dreamed a
  far-reaching dream.</p>

  <p>And at that moment there entered the room a youth to whom Croft's heart
  went out. Clean-limbed, strong-featured, with a well-shaped jaw, and a mouth
  not lacking in humor, he advanced with a springing stride and stood before
  the king.</p>

  <p>"Robur, my son," Jadgor began. "Jasor of Nodhur is our guest. In all
  things shall you aid him, speaking in all such matters as the mouthpiece of
  the king. See to it that he has metal-workers under his command to do his
  bidding, also that wine is given into his hands for such use as he sees
  fit."</p>

  <p>Robur put forth a hand, which Croft took in his own. The Prince of Aphur
  smiled. "My father's word is the law in Aphur," he said. "Welcome, Nodhur.
  Ask and I obey."</p>

  <p>"First, then," said Croft, "I would visit my father's galley at the quays
  and acquaint them with what has occurred before they continue up the Na."</p>

  <p>"Come, then," Robur responded to the natural request.</p>

  <p>He led Croft from the room. Five minutes later the two men were driving
  down the terraced inclines to the quay where Sinon's galley lay. Not only
  that, but at his own request, Croft held the reins above the four gnuppas and
  guided them down the sloping roads. He felt for the first time that at last
  he stood on the threshold of that success for which he had planned.</p>

  <p>AND thus he began that work on Palos which was to hold him for many
  months.</p>

  <p>He presented Sinon and Mellia to Robur, and after an hour spent in
  explanations, and ending with a promise to visit Ladhra after he had his work
  in Himyra started, he left them divided between amazement and pride in their
  son.</p>

  <p>"Once what I intend is completed, we will mount these splendid roads
  without gnuppas, and at many times their speed," he said as Robur and he
  re-entered the prince's car.</p>

  <p>Robur opened his eyes. "Say you so? Is it for that I am to aid you as my
  father said?"</p>

  <p>"Aye."</p>

  <p>"Then let us begin at once. I would like to see the thing accomplished,"
  Robur urged.</p>

  <p>Croft nodded and briefly described what was required.</p>

  <p>"There is a place where the doors of metal and the bodies of the chariots
  and carriage are molded," Robur said.</p>

  <p>"Metal is melted and worked into shape, according to designs."</p>

  <p>Croft had felt assured that some such industry existed from the molded
  doors and the type of the other metalwork he had seen.</p>

  <p>"Take me there, O Robur of Aphur," he said.</p>

  <p>Robur laughed. He was an exceedingly companionable man.</p>

  <p>"Call me not by so lengthy a title," he exclaimed. "I am drawn to you,
  Jasor. Let us forget questions of caste or rank between ourselves. Speak to
  me as Rob."</p>

  <p>"Gladly will I call you so," said Croft, his heart warming to this
  proffered friendship of Aphur's heir. "And let us pledge ourselves now to
  work for the welfare of our nation until it is assured."</p>

  <p>He thrust out a hand.</p>

  <p>Robur's eyes lighted as they held Croft's palm. "This is a day of wonder
  for all Tamarizia," he said, and turned the gnuppas southward along the river
  road.</p>

  <p>In the end he brought them to a stand before an enormous building, wherein
  Croft found the flares of fires, and men, well- nigh naked, at work in their
  glare. Robur led him to the captain in charge of the place, and made him
  acquainted with Croft's needs. Inside an hour Croft was superintending the
  makings of certain wooden patterns, to be molded and cast in tempered copper,
  while Robur looked on, all eyes.</p>

  <p>And his eyes were glinting as they left the Palosian foundry and drove
  toward the royal depots of wines, after Croft had given certain of the
  metal-workers the designs for a huge copper retort to be made at once.</p>

  <p>At the depots, where Croft found unlimited supplies of wine, stored in
  skin bottles of tabur hide, Jason ordered the building of a brick furnace for
  the retort when it was done, giving the dimensions and plans of construction
  to masons hurriedly called. That task arranged for, Robur drove him back to
  the palace, and led him straight to his own private suite.</p>

  <p>A woman rose as they entered. She was sweet-faced, with brown eyes and
  hair. Robur presented Croft to her as his wife, a princess of Milidhur, and
  proudly displayed two children, a boy and a girl.</p>

  <p>Croft found his reception gracious in the extreme, and learned he was to
  be the guest of Robur and Gaya while engaged in his work. He was to learn
  also that Gaya was no uncommon name in Tamarizia, and that it fitted the wife
  of Aphur's prince. She was a cheerful, bright, and sympathetic soul, who
  listened to Robur's and Croft's description of their plans, and cried out
  with delight at what they proposed.</p>

  <p>THEREAFTER the days passed quickly, and Croft checked off each as it fled
  as bringing one day nearer the time set for the formal betrothal of Naia to
  Kyphallos, whom, he learned, was also a guest of the palace, through meeting
  him now and again, and questioning the prince, whom, when alone, he now
  called Rob.</p>

  <p>And as the days passed, part after part of the new engine which was to
  revolutionize transportation on Palos was drafted, molded, and made. Robur's
  wonder grew, as it seemed, with the making of each new part, and his
  impatience of the final result became intense.</p>

  <p>But many hands made rapid work. Croft selected each man who showed any
  particular aptitude and delegated him to that individual task. The huge
  retort was set up and was producing pure alcoholic spirit every day. Inside
  ten days Croft himself began the assembling of the already finished parts. At
  his own request, Robur was permitted to assist. More than once Croft smiled
  to himself as he beheld the crown prince of Aphur soiled, grimy, smudged, and
  enjoying himself immensely, tugging away at a wrench or wielding a
  riveting-hammer on the growing work of wonder which they built.</p>

  <p>To gain speed, Croft had introduced the unheard-of night-shift in Himyra.
  Day and night now the work went on, and his first creation advanced apace.
  Only on the winding of the magneto did he maintain great secrecy. Over that
  he and Robur worked alone. It was the main, essential part, he explained to
  the prince. Without it the whole thing would be useless and dead. He even
  tried to make Robur understand the electric nature of the device and,
  failing, told him it was the same as the lightning in the clouds.</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" cried Robur with a glance of something akin to fright. "Jasor,
  would you harness Zitu's fire?"</p>

  <p>"By Zitu's permission," Croft said.</p>

  <p>Aphur's prince studied that. "Aye," he said at length. "My friend, you are
  a strange and wonderful man. Jadgor believes that Zitu himself had endowed
  your mind, and Magur says as much in your favor, also."</p>

  <p>"Magur speaks the truth," Croft declared, once more sensing a possible
  means of harmonizing the approaching need for his return to earth, were he to
  keep the bond unbroken between Palos and his earthly body.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Rob. Strange things occurred in this body of mine in Scira. At
  times&mdash;when the need occurs&mdash;it shall fall asleep; and from each
  sleep shall it return with new knowledge for the good of Tamarizia's race,
  and the confounding of Zollaria's plans."</p>

  <p>"Zollaria! Hai!" Robur exclaimed. It was the first time Croft had
  mentioned the northern nation to him.</p>

  <p>"To oppose which Jadgor designs to betroth your cousin to Kyphallos of
  Cathur." Suddenly Croft grew bold.</p>

  <p>Robur frowned.</p>

  <p>"Rob," Croft went on, "I would ask a favor if it may be granted."</p>

  <p>"Speak," Robur said.</p>

  <p>"I would be present at the betrothal-feast inside the next few days."</p>

  <p>"By. Zitu, and you shall," Robur declared.</p>

  <p>"My caste&mdash;" Croft began.</p>

  <p>Robur laughed and tapped him on the breast with a wrench.</p>

  <p>"Rise, <i>Hupor</i>! If this work succeeds, that will be arranged."</p>

  <p>Croft felt his pulses quicken. "You mean&mdash;" he began again, and once
  more paused.</p>

  <p>Robur nodded. "That Jadgor, my father, will raise you to the first rank
  be-neath the throne."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">XII. &mdash; THE NEW PRINCE, HUPOR JASOR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON the day before the betrothal-feast Croft finished his
  magneto, tested it out before Robur's eyes, and obtained a good, fat spark.
  Hastily connecting it with the now assembled motor, for which workmen were
  building a chassis such as Palos had never seen, he filled a testing-tank
  with spirit, primed the carburetor that he had somewhat changed for the use
  of the different fuel, and then laid hold of the crank. It was a tense
  moment, and his voice showed his realization of the fact as he spoke to
  Robur:</p>

  <p>"Watch now, Rob&mdash;watch!"</p>

  <p>He spun the crank around. For the first time on Palos there came a motor's
  cough. Again Croft whirred the crank, spinning it to generate the life-giving
  spark. He was answered by a hearty hum. The motor quivered and shook. A
  staccato sound of steady explosions filled the room in which it stood. Like
  gun-fire its exhaust broke forth. The heavy balance-wheel Croft had arranged
  for the trial to load it to safety spun swiftly round and round.</p>

  <p>A commotion rose in the shop. Captains and sub-captains ran from their
  work to view the success of that for which they had worked. They stood
  staring at the throbbing, quivering engine.</p>

  <p>Croft straightened and stood, pale of face but with blazing eyes, before
  them. He had won! Won! Robur's face told him he had won! It was a face filled
  with a mighty wonder and delight.</p>

  <p>And suddenly the crown prince spoke:</p>

  <p>"Back&mdash;back to your work. Work as ye have never worked before.
  Complete the frame for this to ride upon, the wheels. Make all ready, men of
  Aphur, and spare no effort to the aim. A new day has dawned in Aphur&mdash;in
  Tamarizia. Inside the hour there shall be a new prince. Salute him, Hupor
  Jasor, who thus has served the state."</p>

  <p>They lifted their hands in salute, those captains, and turned away. Croft
  looked into Robur's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Rob," he stammered, and put out his hands. "Rob&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aye," Robur said. "Such is the order of Aphur's king did the test we were
  to make today succeed. He will himself confirm it tomorrow night. In the
  meantime I am told to bid Jasor to the betrothal feast of Naia of Aphur to
  Cathur's prince. What now of caste my friend?"</p>

  <p>Croft quivered. He shook in every limb. The gulf was bridged&mdash;that
  gulf of rank between himself and the girl of gold at the shrine of whose
  sweet presence his own spirit bowed. He opened his lips yet found himself
  overwhelmed with emotion, unable to speak. Robur cast an arm about his
  shoulders as the two men stood.</p>

  <p>"Jasor, my friend," he once more began. "Means this thing so much to you?
  Why? What things have you in mind I know not of?</p>

  <p>"Speak. Know you not, Jasor, that I love you?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Croft. "Yet Rob, I may not speak of those things as yet."</p>

  <p>Nor did he feel that he could at present confess the thing in his heart.
  "Later you shall know all," he declared. "As for the rest&mdash;you are my
  dearest friend."</p>

  <p>"Speak when you will," Robur replied. "Tomorrow at the house of Prince
  Lakkon, Jadgor shall name you Hupor before the nobles of Aphur. So is it
  planned. And when this motur of ours is completed, you shall drive it to
  Ladhra and take with you the noble rank for Sinon, since he has served his
  state in bringing about your birth."</p>

  <p>Tomorrow night at the house of Prince Lakkon! The words rang in Croft's
  brain. Naia&mdash;his beloved should see him exalted, made a noble of Aphur.
  What more auspicious meeting could he desire than this? It was
  fate&mdash;fate.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Croft felt his face flush and his eyes took on a flashing light.
  "Rob," he cried. "This is only the beginning. What we shall do for Tamarizia
  Zitu only knows."</p>

  <p>"Would Zitu had sent you before this then," Robur growled.</p>

  <p>Croft noted his change of manner with amaze, and plainly Robur was not
  unmindful of his regard.</p>

  <p>"I question not the wisdom of Jadgor, my father," he went on quickly. "Yet
  like I not this sacrifice of a virgin maid to the lecherous son of Cathur's
  king."</p>

  <p>"Rob!" Croft cried, as his friend and comrade paused and caught a single
  lung-filling breath and went on. "Zitu himself must frown upon such a
  thing."</p>

  <p>Robur eyed him with mounting interest, and suddenly Croft raced ahead in
  eager question. "Rob&mdash;how long between the night of betrothal and the
  marriage itself?"</p>

  <p>"Hai!" Robur narrowed his eyes. "A cycle, my friend. By royal custom these
  things are never matters of haste."</p>

  <p>"A cycle!" Croft threw up his head and laughed. "Rob, could we make
  Tamarizia strong beyond any dream of her wisest men inside that cycle, what
  then?"</p>

  <p>Robur frowned. "A promise is a promise, my friend."</p>

  <p>"But," said Croft, "Much may happen in a cycle&mdash;and Zollaria
  plans..."</p>

  <p>"What mean you?" Robur seized his arm in a grip like iron,
  "Jasor&mdash;you are a strange man. Twice now have you spoken of Zollaria's
  plans. What do you have in mind?"</p>

  <p>"To watch Cathur's prince," said Croft. "Hold, Rob&mdash;the priest, Abbu,
  is my friend. He will help us in this. Magur, too, must give us aid. Let us
  watch&mdash;and work."</p>

  <p>Work&mdash;yes, work. With a Sirian year in which to work for such a prize
  what could a man not do? Croft threw up his face and met Robur's questioning
  gaze: "Aphur shall show the way to the nation," he cried. "Zollaria's plans
  shall come to naught, my friend."</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" Robur gasped. "After tomorrow night we must speak of these things
  to Aphur's king. Jasor, I am minded that Magur is right. Zitu works through
  you to his ends."</p>

  <p>The motor coughed and died, having used up its fuel. Croft smiled, and
  called Robur back to work. Through the day they toiled, and by night the
  engine was bolted to-the chassis, wheeled into the assembling-room by the
  workmen that afternoon. There remained now no more than the assembling of the
  clutch and the transmission before the body should be affixed to complete the
  car. And the body was ready and waiting to be bolted fast.</p>

  <p>Croft worked throughout the night. Robur offered to assist, but he
  refused. He wanted to be alone&mdash;to think&mdash;think&mdash;plan the
  future steps of those things he would do inside the coming year. He had sworn
  to make Aphur strong. And as he assembled the final portions of this first
  work of his genius, he considered that.</p>

  <p>The answer was plain. Aphur must arm&mdash;and Nodhur&mdash;and Milidhur
  from whence came the gentle, sweetly sympathetic, Gaya, Robur's wife. And of
  arms he knew little, but&mdash;he could learn. Only he had to return to
  earth. There, not many miles from his own town, was the home of a man who
  before now had won fame as a maker of arms. Indeed, as Croft knew he had
  designed weapons afterward adopted by the royal nations of Europe and made by
  them on a patent lease from this man, Croft's friend.</p>

  <p>It would be easy, then, to learn what he desired; to bring back the plans
  of those selfsame weapons and make them here under the patronage of Aphur's
  king. Then&mdash;well&mdash;let Zollaria plan and hold what bait she would
  before Cathur's eyes. Croft chuckled to himself as he worked, and the captain
  assisting him in Robur's place thought him pleased with their progress and
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"This motur of thine will surely draw the car in lieu of gnuppas, my
  lord?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Croft with a nod.</p>

  <p>"By Zitu! Never was anything like it dreamed of in Tamarizia before thy
  coming," the captain rumbled in his throat.</p>

  <p>Croft nodded again. "Tomorrow I shall bring you orders to start all men
  working on those parts they have made for this, in untold numbers," he
  returned. "And hark you, captain. Each man shall make but the one
  part&mdash;which he makes the best. So shall we make many and build them
  together at once and produce a vast number of cars, and other motors to drive
  boats on the Na."</p>

  <p>"By Zitu! Then shall Aphur rule the seas indeed."</p>

  <p>"Tamarizia shall rule," said Croft with an assurance not to be denied.</p>

  <p>The captain gave him a glance. What he read carried conviction to his
  mind. "My lord," he said. "My lord."</p>

  <p>"Lord." They called him that now. Croft chuckled again to himself and went
  to work. Lord. And tomorrow night&mdash;no, the night of this day as it would
  be on earth&mdash;they would call him "lord" before Naia herself. He would
  meet her&mdash;speak to her, perhaps. He called upon the captain for
  assistance and redoubled his rate of work.</p>

  <p>And as the first rays of Sirius began to gild the red walls of Himyra, he
  finished filling the fuel tank with spirits, told the captain to open wide
  the doors of the building wherein they had toiled through the night, and
  seized hold upon the crank of the engine he had built.</p>

  <p>The motor roared out. Croft sprang to the driver's seat. He let in his
  clutch. And slowly&mdash;very slowly the car moved toward the open doors.</p>

  <p>One glimpse Jason had of the captain's face&mdash;a thing wide-eyed, agape
  with amazed belief, and then he was outside the massive walls of that foundry
  womb in which the car had been formed. He was out in the streets of Himyra,
  riding the thing he had made&mdash;the first of many things as he had
  determined during the night.</p>

  <p>For a moment visions of marine motors, tractors, airplanes, filled his
  brain. Then as a night guard at the throat of the street caught sight of him,
  and wavering between fear and duty, yielded swiftly to the former and fled
  with a yell of terror, he came back to the matter in hand.</p>

  <p>He gained the river road and opened the throttle notch by notch. Swiftly
  and more swiftly the new car moved. The sweet air of morning sang about his
  ears. The throb of the motor was a paean of praise&mdash;a promise of what
  was to come. He reached the palace entrance and turned in. Straight to the
  steps of the king's wing he drove and brought the car to a stand.</p>

  <p>Like their fellow of the street, the guards shrank back in amazement from
  this strangest of chariots they had ever seen, until Croft, rising in his
  seat, ordered them to send word to Robur and Jadgor himself, that he waited
  their inspection of the car. He himself was thrilling with creative fire,
  divine. It was in his mind to demonstrate the new creation in the vast court,
  deserted thus early in the day. He throttled down and sat waiting while a
  guardsman hurried away.</p>

  <p>Then into the midst of his elation broke the voice of Aphur's prince.</p>

  <p>"Hai, Jasor, my lord, this is a surprise. Now I see that which last night
  you planned."</p>

  <p>Robur had hurried forth with Gaya by his side, and behind him now came
  Jadgor, between a double row of guards.</p>

  <p>While Croft rose and gave a hand to Robur and Gaya in turn, and bowed
  before the king, the latter advanced quite to the side of the new, and to his
  experience, wonderful machine.</p>

  <p>"You came here in the motur itself?" Robur asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Croft replied. "And well nigh frightened a night guard out of his
  wits when he saw me bearing down on him, as well as carrying consternation
  into the minds of even soldiers here."</p>

  <p>Robur laughed. "I can well believe that," he agreed. "Had I known not of
  it I fear I should have been sadly disturbed myself."</p>

  <p>Jadgor smiled. "If it carried fear into the hearts of Aphur's guards,
  might it not do likewise to an enemy's men as well?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"O king, it is in my mind that it would do even that," Croft returned,
  sensing the deeper meaning back of the mere words as applying to a specific
  enemy. He gave Jadgor a meaning glance. "May I show you the motur in action,
  O King of Aphur?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Jadgor agreed.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" Robur cried, as Croft resumed his seat. "Wait, Jasor, I shall go
  with you. Gaya will be the first woman of Aphur to ride in such a
  chariot."</p>

  <p>Gaya smiled. Like most of the Tamarizian women, Croft had seen she seemed
  devoid of any particular fear. She took Robur's hand and stepped into the
  car. Robur followed with scant dignity in his eagerness to put this new mode
  of travel to the test.</p>

  <p>Then Croft engaged his clutch and the car moved off, rolling without
  apparent means of propulsion in circles about the great red court while the
  guards and Jadgor watched. For some five minutes Croft kept up the circling
  before he brought the machine to a stand before the king, and once more
  rising, bowed.</p>

  <p>"Your words were true, O Jasor," spoke Jadgor then. "In this I see great
  service to the state. Hail Hupor!"</p>

  <p>He caught a sword from the nearest soldier, and advancing, struck Croft
  lightly upon the breast with the flat of the blade.</p>

  <p>"More of this to-night," he said, stepping back. "In the meantime arrange
  to build as many of these moturs as you may&mdash;also for those which shall
  propel the boats."</p>

  <p>Turning, he withdrew with his guard, disappearing into the palace.</p>

  <p>Gaya smiled at her husband and Croft. "I, too, shall withdraw now," she
  began. "I can see you are eager to be alone with this new toy. My thanks,
  Lord Jasor, for the ride. All my life long I shall remember myself the first
  of Tamarizian women to mount your wonderful car."</p>

  <p>Robur helped her to get out, then sprang back to Croft's side. His face
  was alight. "Now&mdash;go! Let us ride!" he exclaimed. "Let us leave the city
  along the highway to the south and test the motur for speed."</p>

  <p>Nothing loth, Croft once more advanced gas and spark and let in the
  clutch. Outside the palace entrance he turned south along the Na. Robur,
  beside him, seemed strangely like a boy.</p>

  <p>"Approach the gate slowly," he chuckled as they rode. "Let me see for
  myself what effect we have on the guards."</p>

  <p>His wish was granted in a surprisingly short time. As they neared the
  gate, not yet open to morning traffic, a guardsman, appeared. Plainly he was
  watching, yet he made no move. He seemed practically paralyzed at the sight
  which met his eyes. In the end, however, he suddenly lifted his spear as
  though expecting to meet a charge with its point.</p>

  <p>His face was rigidly set. He appeared one determined to die in the path of
  duty if die he must.</p>

  <p>"Open, fellow!" Robur shouted with a grin.</p>

  <p>His voice wrought a change in the man. He caught a deep breath, dropped
  his spear and flung himself toward the levers which worked the gate. "My
  lord," he said, as Croft drove past where he now stood at attention with the
  gate swung wide. "My lord!"</p>

  <p>Robur flung him a bit of silver and a laugh. Then they were out of the
  tunnel through the wall and rushing up the well-built road. "That fellow
  thought us Zutemque himself, to judge by his expression," he chuckled.
  "Jasor, my friend, go faster, let&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let her out!" Croft could not resist the expression of earth.</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Robur, staring. "Let&mdash;her&mdash;out. Where got you that
  form of speech, my friend?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;it was used on the moment to express the idea intended," Croft
  replied. "It is as though one released the reins and allowed the gnuppas to
  run free."</p>

  <p>Robur nodded. "Yes, I sense it. Let&mdash;her-out."</p>

  <p>Croft complied. They sped south. Without a speedometer Croft could only
  estimate their rate of progress, but he judged the new engine made thirty
  miles an hour at least.</p>

  <p>Robur was amazed. So were others after a time. The speeding car met the
  first of the early market throng and cleared the road of everything it met.
  Men, women, and live stock bolted as the undreamed engine of locomotion
  roared past. Their cries blended into an uproar which tore laughter from
  Robur's throat. Croft himself gave way to more than one smile.</p>

  <p>Swiftly they passed the area of cultivation and entered the desert road
  where Croft had seen the sarpelca caravan on his first Palosian day. On, on
  they roared along the level surface between dunes of yellow sand and across
  golden arid flats. The exhilaration of motion was in their veins. Head down
  above his wheel Croft sent the car ahead, until dashing between two dunes
  they came to where a second road joined that on which they ran.</p>

  <p>Robur cried out. Croft flung up his head. One swift glimpse he had of a
  team of purple-plumed gnuppas reared on their haunches, their forefeet pawing
  the air, their nostrils flaring, their eyes maddened with fright, and of a
  burnished carriage behind them. Then he was past, throttling the engine,
  seeking to bring the car to a stand. While from behind the sound of a strong
  man shouting, came hoarsely to his ears.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">XIII. &mdash; HOW NAIA FIRST SAW JASOR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE car slowed down and stood still.</p>

  <p>Robur sprang to his feet. Croft turned to look back. The carriage was off
  the road and dashing across a level stretch of sand.</p>

  <p>How it came that Prince Lakkon's carriage was here, neither man knew. They
  were to only learn later that Naia, wearied of her preparations for the
  coming feast of betrothal, had induced her father to take here to her
  mountain home on the previous night, and that now she was returning in time
  to avoid the later heat of the Sirian day. Yet both men had recognized the
  purple-plumed gnuppas and the conveyance which now swayed and rocked behind
  their fright-maddened flight.</p>

  <p>"Lakkon's!" Croft gasped.</p>

  <p>"Aye, by Zitu," Robur gave assent. "And should Chythron fail to hold them
  soon, death lies in that direction at the bottom of the gorge."</p>

  <p>"Sit down. Hold fast!" Even as Robur spoke. Croft sensed his full meaning
  and planned. Under his touch the engine roared. He let in his clutch with a
  jerk which shot the car into motion with a leap. Death lay ahead of the
  careening carriage behind the beasts he had frightened out of their driver's
  control. Whether Chythron alone or Lakkon or the prince and his daughter rode
  in that rocking conveyance it was his place to do what he could. Leaving the
  road with a lurch which nearly unseated Robur and himself, he swung the car
  about and in-creased its speed.</p>

  <p>He had told Jadgor he would build an engine to outrun the Tamarizian
  gnuppa, and here at once was the test. True, Croft thought not of that in any
  such fashion as he drove. His only fear was lest he fail to overhaul the
  flying beasts in time. His greatest fear was that Naia herself might be in
  that frantic rush toward death, hurtling to an end invoked at his hands. His
  soul sank in a sick wave of horror. Yet he set his lips and clenched his jaws
  and drove.</p>

  <p>Faster and faster leaped the roaring car behind the leaping things of
  flesh and blood he sought to overtake. And he was overtaking them now. He
  crossed the second road with a nerve- wracking swing and jolt. Unable to
  procure rubber for his wheels he had faced them with heavy leather some two
  inches thick, which lacked the resiliency of air. His arms ached from the
  wrench with which he crossed the road. But that past he gathered speed with
  every revolution of the wheels.</p>

  <p>"Faster! Zitu! Faster!" Robur urged at his side. "Faster, Jasor&mdash;the
  gorge is just ahead!"</p>

  <p>Croft made no reply. He was almost abreast of the carriage now. But he
  himself had seen the break in the surface of the flat across which he drove.
  He set his teeth till the muscles in his strong jaws bunched and drove toward
  it at top speed. His one hope was that the thing which had set the gnuppas
  into flight might be able to turn them back. And he was past them now! Past
  them, with the gorge directly ahead. He began to edge in upon them. He would
  stop them or turn them at any cost to himself. And the margin was scant.</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer to the lip of the sheer descent he was forced to turn in
  order to hold his lead.</p>

  <p>"Jump! Save yourself!" His voice rose in a cry of warning to his companion
  in the car. The gorge was very close. He turned to parallel its course and
  found it angling off at a slant. And the gnuppas were turning,
  too&mdash;edging away from the thing they feared&mdash;edging, edging away.
  Croft edged with them, turning them more and more. Chythron was sawing on his
  reins. Suddenly the beasts stopped in a series of ragged lunges and stood
  quivering and panting. Croft stopped the car.</p>

  <p>"By Zitu! Jasor, you are a man!"</p>

  <p>He became conscious that Robur was still with him on the seat, and that he
  himself was aquiver in every limb. Yet he forgot that as the purple curtains
  of the carriage were swept back and Prince Lakkon leaped out, gave Robur and
  him a swift glance, and assisted Naia to alight.</p>

  <p>Robur and he leaped down. They advanced toward Lakkon and his
  daughter.</p>

  <p>"My uncle and my cousin," Robur began; "we crave your pardon for causing
  you this inconvenience through no intent of our own. Yet must you give thanks
  to our brave Lord Jasor here for undoing our work so quickly as he might, and
  turning back the gnuppas from their course. By Zitu, I am assured, had he not
  succeeded he would have gone with you into the gorge."</p>

  <p>Lakkon bowed. "My Lord Jasor," said he, "it appears that I owe you my
  safety as well as that of my child. Accept my service at your need. I have
  heard of you and yonder wonder-carriage you have wrought. After tonight I go
  to my villa in the mountains. You must be our guest for a time. Naia, my
  child, extend your thanks to the noble Jasor for your life."</p>

  <p>Croft found himself looking into the purple eyes of the woman he loved. He
  thrilled as she lifted her glance. Then, as her red lips parted, he opened
  his own.</p>

  <p>"Nay, not your life. Princess Naia&mdash;some bruises had you leaped from
  the carriage, perhaps."</p>

  <p>"My thanks for the service none the less, my lord," she made answer in her
  own well-remembered voice. "I like not bruises truly, and at least you did
  save me those."</p>

  <p>She extended a slender hand.</p>

  <p>Croft took her fingers in his and found his pulses leaping at the contact.
  What more favorable meeting could have brought him before this girl in the
  flesh? Prompted by a sudden impulse, he bent and set his lips to the fingers
  he held, straightened and looked deep into the wells of her eyes.</p>

  <p>A swift color mounted into the maiden's cheeks at the unwonted form of
  homage and the fire in Croft's glance. She dropped her lids and seemed
  confused for the first time during the course of the whole affair.</p>

  <p>Robur broke into the rather tense pause. "What say you, Lakkon; your
  gnuppas are hardly fit to be trusted more today. Enter this car our Hupor has
  built, and be the first Prince of Aphur to enter Himyra thus."</p>

  <p>Lakkon smiled. He spoke to Chythron, ordering him to drive the gnuppas to
  the city as best he might. Then, with Croft acting as Naia's guide, turned
  with Robur toward the car.</p>

  <p>Nor was he niggard in his praise as Croft started the engine and, placing
  the girl beside him, drove back to the road and along it to the city gates.
  He even laughed with enjoyment at the further consternation their progress
  caused along the road, and when a team of draft gnuppas, bolting, scattered a
  mass of broken crates full of the strange water-fowl Croft had found the
  first day in a squawking confusion, he scattered largesse to the owner of
  team and load and bade Croft proceed.</p>

  <p>As for Croft, that ride with the girl of his ultimate desire at his side
  was a delight, such as he had never known. Coupled with the sense that he had
  saved her from possible injury at least, if not from actual death, and at the
  same time proved his own daring, was blended the sheer enjoyment of her
  presence and the sound of her voice as she questioned him concerning
  the&mdash;to her&mdash;marvelous, conveyance he drove. Those questions he
  answered freely, knowing her loyal to Tamarizia at heart.</p>

  <p>So in the end they passed the city gates and made their way to Lakkon's
  house, where Croft turned in toward the massive moulded doors.</p>

  <p>Naia showed some surprise. "My lord," she said, "you know our dwelling, it
  would seem."</p>

  <p>"I have looked upon it with longing ere this," said Croft, growing bold
  through the kindness of fate. For fate he felt it was which had brought them
  together in a fashion such as this.</p>

  <p>And Naia gave him a glance and once more veiled her eyes while a tide of
  responsive color dyed her face. Plainly she caught the meaning of his
  words.</p>

  <p>"Your name is among those of our guests for tonight," she said. "Your
  welcome will be doubly great after today, and&mdash;you will accept our
  invitation to the mountains?"</p>

  <p>"If you add your invitation to your father's, so soon as I may arrange the
  work on other moturs," Croft agreed.</p>

  <p>"Then you will come," she told him softly without lifting her eyes. And
  Croft thrilled at her manner as much as at her words. He stopped the car,
  reached up and rang the gong as Chythron had done the first day he came to
  Aphur, leaped out and assisted Naia to alight.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">XIV. &mdash; THE SLIP 'TWIXT CUP AND LIP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AND that night all Himyra was <i>en fte</i>. Under the
  light of fire-urns, oil lamps, and flaring torches, whose glare lit up the
  sky above the walls, the Red City of Aphur made holiday. Crowds swarmed the
  public squares and clustered about the free entertainments, the free
  refreshment booths erected by order of Jadgor, Aphur's king, to celebrate the
  coming alliance between Cathur and the state.</p>

  <p>Processions of the people moved through the streets, laughing, singing,
  shouting and making merry in honor of the event. Once before when Robur
  brought a princess of Milidhur to Himyra the city had flared thus red in the
  night. Now again Jadgor was making greater his prestige of power and
  increasing Aphur's political might.</p>

  <p>Croft, returning to his quarters in the palace from a day spent in
  starting intensive work on a hundred engines and a marine adoption of the
  same, met a surprise.</p>

  <p>Upon his copper couch was a noble dress consisting of a golden cuirass
  embossed in silver, a kilted skirt, gold and silver leg. casings, and
  sandals, a leathern belt, and a tempered copper sword.</p>

  <p>As he came in a Mazzerian servant rose and bade him to one of the palace
  baths. Returning from that, Croft donned a sleeveless shirt of silk-like
  tissue and the cuirass over that. Kneeling, the servant adjusted the sandals
  and rose to buckle on the sword. These things he mentioned were a gift from
  Jadgor himself, a mark of Croft's service to the state.</p>

  <p>Jason had been less than human had he not felt a glow of satisfaction in
  this sign of royal esteem and friendship. But greater far than that was the
  knowledge that this night in Lakkon's house he would meet Naia herself as a
  friend already known, and be lifted to high rank before her eyes. That
  tonight would see her pledged to Kyphallos, he chose to overlook. A year must
  follow before she became the Cathurian's wife. Much could happen in a year,
  as he had said to Robur days ago. Something he had read came into his
  mind.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><i>"Let him who wins her take and keep Faustine."</i></p><br>

  <p>He thought that was the form of the quotation. At least it was the sense.
  He nodded to himself, Let him who could win her take and keep Naia of Aphur.
  He, Croft, had a year in which to win the woman he desired.</p>

  <p>Robur came into the room. Gaya had gone to Lakkon's earlier in the day to
  act as Naia's lady in the ceremonial preparations. He suggested that Croft
  and he be off. Aphurian etiquette decreed that the principal guest be the
  last to arrive, in order that the assembled company might do him honor when
  he came. Jadgor and Kyphallos would follow, said the prince. Croft assented
  at once. Lifting a circlet supporting a tuft of orange feathers, he set it
  upon his head, and Robur and he set out, in the prince's own car, drawn by
  four beautiful gnuppas, their bridles trimmed with nodding scarlet
  plumes.</p>

  <p>Before Lakkon's house they found themselves in a press of other carriages
  and chariots from which were descending the best of Aphur's life. The huge
  doors of the court stood open, and the court itself blazed with light. A
  double line of guards stood within the portals as the guests streamed in, and
  a herald in gold and purple cried the name of each new arrival aloud through
  a wide-mouthed trumpet held before his lips.</p>

  <p>Inside, the tables were spread much as on the former occasion Croft had
  witnessed, save that now a dais had been constructed at one end, where were
  the places of Kyphallos and Naia, Jadgor and Lakkon, and as Jason was to
  learn of Robur, Gaya and himself. Lakkon stood at the end of the double row
  of guards and welcomed his guests. He gave Croft his hand with a smile which
  lighted his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, Lord Jasor&mdash;to mine house&mdash;to Himyra's happiness, to
  the honor of Aphur," he said, and bent his knee to Robur as the two men
  passed.</p>

  <p>It was then Robur led Croft to the dais and mounted the steps as one who
  knew beforehand his place assigned. Croft hung back, and his companion
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"Up," he cried. "Tonight you are honored of Aphur above most men."</p>

  <p>Tingling at the knowledge, Croft mounted and seated himself at a wave from
  Robur's hand. The prince gazed on the brilliant scene with a smile of
  something like pride.</p>

  <p>"A goodly company," he said.</p>

  <p>Croft, too, gazed around before he replied. Surely Robur had spoken
  aright, he thought as he swept the body of the guests where colors blended in
  endless harmony of shades, and the white arms and shoulders of matron and
  maid gleamed in the play of the lights.</p>

  <p>Lights! He cast his eyes about the myriad of flaming lamps and suddenly he
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Yet would it be even more brilliant were the oil lamps removed and in
  their place we were to put small globes of glass which would emit a radiance
  not due to oil, but to a glowing filament shut within them, so that they
  would need no filling, but would burn when a small knob were turned."</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" Robur gave him a glance. "Are you at it again&mdash;with your
  wonderful dreams?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Once more Croft smiled and grew serious as it recurred to his mind
  that before long he must again return to earth. "Call them dreams, Rob," he
  said. "Dreams they may be&mdash;yet shall you see them come true.
  And&mdash;listen, my loyal friend; it may be that before long I shall dream
  again as I dreamed before&mdash;that my body shall lie as Jasor's body lay in
  Scira&mdash;shall seem to die."</p>

  <p>"What mean you?" Robur cried. "This you have said before."</p>

  <p>Croft shook his head. "I may not tell you more; yet I would exact your
  promise that when the time comes, as I know it will, you shall set a guard
  about my body and forbid that it be disturbed until I shall again awake with
  a full-knowledge of what more shall be done for Aphur's good."</p>

  <p>"You mean this&mdash;you do not jest?" Robur's voice had grown little
  better than a whisper, and his eyes burned the question into Croft's
  brain.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Will you promise, Rob?"</p>

  <p>"I will promise, and what I promise I fulfill," said Robur. "Yet&mdash;you
  arouse fancies within me, Jasor. One would think Zitu himself spoke to you in
  that sleep."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;yet what I do, I do by His grace," Croft replied. "And from each
  sleep I am assured shall come good to the Tamarizian race."</p>

  <p>And suddenly, as trumpets announced the arrival of Kyphallos and the King,
  he felt light, relieved, free. He had arranged for those periods of
  unconsciousness for Jasor's body, and need not trouble more about it with the
  promise he had won from Jadgor's son.</p>

  <p>He watched while Kyphallos came in with Jadgor now and approached the
  dais. Then, attracted by other trumpets, he turned toward the stair. As
  before, Naia stood there with Gaya by her side. Yet now she was not the same.
  Then she had been radiant in gold and purple. Now she stood simply clad in
  white. White was her robe, edged in silver; white were her sandals and white
  the plumes which rose above her hair.</p>

  <p>Kyphallos and Jadgor waited while the guests took their seats. Lakkon
  advanced to meet the two women on the stairs, gave his hand to his daughter
  and turned to descend.</p>

  <p>Another figure appeared. It was Magur, the priest, robed in blue,
  accompanied by two young boys, each bearing a silver goblet on a tray of the
  same metal. He advanced and met Naia and Lakkon as they reached the foot of
  the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Who comes?" his voice rang out.</p>

  <p>"A maid who would pledge herself and her life to a youth, O Prince of
  Zitu," Lakkon replied.</p>

  <p>"The youth is present?" Magur went on with the ritualistic form.</p>

  <p>"Aye. He stands yonder with Aphur's king," Lakkon declared.</p>

  <p>"Who sponsors this woman at this time?" Magur spoke again.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;King of Aphur&mdash;brother of her who gave her life," Jadgor's
  voice boomed forth.</p>

  <p>"Come then," Magur said.</p>

  <p>The party advanced again across the crystal floor. They joined Kyphallos
  and the king. They ascended the dais and stood before the assembled guests,
  who rose.</p>

  <p>Magur spoke anew.</p>

  <p>"Naia of Aphur&mdash;thou woman&mdash;being woman sister of Ga, and hence
  a priestess of that shrine of life which is eternal, and guardian of the fire
  of life which is eternal, is it your intent to pledge thyself to this man of
  Cathur who stands now at thy side?"</p>

  <p>While Croft watched, Naia's lips moved. "Aye," came her response into the
  ensuing silence. "Myself I pledge to him."</p>

  <p>"And thou, Kyphallos of Cathur, do you accept this pledge and with it the
  woman herself, to make her in the fullness of time thy bride to cherish her
  and cause her to live as a glory to the name of woman to whom all men may
  justly give respect?"</p>

  <p>"Aye! So I pledge, by Zitu, and Azil, Giver of Life," said Cathur's
  prince.</p>

  <p>"Then take ye this, maid of Aphur."</p>

  <p>Magur drew from his robe a looped silver cross and pressed it into her
  hands.</p>

  <p>"Hold it and guard it; look upon is at the symbol of that life eternal
  which through you shall be kept eternal, and which taken from the hands of
  Azil the Angel shall be transmuted within thee into the life of men."</p>

  <p>Turning, he took two goblets and poured wine from one to the other and
  back. One he extended to Naia and one to Cathur's prince.</p>

  <p>"Drink," he said. "Let these symbolize thy two bodies, the life of which
  shall be united from this time on in purpose. Drink, and may Zitu bless ye in
  that union which comes by his intent."</p>

  <p>Cathur raised his goblet. "I drink of thee deeply," he spoke, addressing
  Naia.</p>

  <p>"And of thee I drink," she made answer, and set the wine to her lips. As
  she did so her eyes leaped over the silver rim and met the eyes of Croft. For
  a single instant his glance burned into hers, and she faltered, her hand
  lowered the goblet quickly and she swayed. Yet even so, she caught herself on
  the instant as a storm of applause broke from the guests, and sank to the
  divan, supported by Kyphallos's hand.</p>

  <p>As for Croft, for him the light of the oil lamps flickered and paled. He
  sat momentarily lost in a mental tumult roused by that glance in Naia's eyes.
  In that moment he felt he had spoken to her soul&mdash;had reached to her
  inmost spirit, and made himself known. He had not meant to do it. He had not
  realized while he leaned forward watching the betrothal rite, that all his
  loathing of it, all his protest of spirit against it, had kindled in his
  eyes. Not, indeed, until he had plumbed the purple depths of her eyes over
  the rim of the goblet had he known&mdash;or dreamed that she could see and
  know&mdash;as now he felt she had known.</p>

  <p>Now, however, he stole a second glance to where she sat and found her
  deathly pale with set lips and a bosom heaving so strongly beneath the pure
  white fabric of her robe, that it seemed to actually flutter above her
  rounded breasts. Her hand stole out and lifted a goblet from the table and
  she drank. It seemed to Croft that she sought so to steady herself before she
  set the wine back, and forced herself to smile.</p>

  <p>Thereafter came the feast, the music, the dancers, a troupe of singers and
  another of acrobats&mdash;the usual gamut of a Tamarizian state
  entertainment, dragging out its length, before Jadgor rose at last in his
  place and a hush fell over the court.</p>

  <p>Croft, who throughout it all had been strangely silent, roused to the
  pressure of Robur's hand, and as the prince prompted, he rose.</p>

  <p>Thereafter he left his place and knelt before Jadgor while the king drew
  his sword and struck him upon the breast and dubbed him so a Prince of Aphur,
  and, rising, bowed to the king and to the guests who rose to salute him in
  his new-found rank. But of them all to Croft it seemed that he saw only the
  fair young girl beside the Cathurian prince. And now, as before, his
  eyes-leaped swiftly to her face.</p>

  <p>Only now, instead of an expression of something like a startled knowledge,
  there leaped toward him a purple light of pleasure, of approval, of
  congratulation, and she smiled, as one may smile in recognition of an old and
  well-known friend.</p>

  <p>Then he found himself clasping hands with Robur, with Lakkon, with
  Kyphallos, since the thing could not be avoided. Gaya, too, gave him her hand
  and a word of congratulation, and&mdash;Naia was holding forth her rounded,
  bare arm and the slender fingers which that morning he had kissed. He took
  them now and held them in his own. He trembled, and knew it, and even so
  dared again to meet her eyes. Once more he found them startled, puzzled,
  almost confused. A faint color crept into her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"My lord," she said, "Aphur has given her highest appreciation of your
  worth. That should mean much to you."</p>

  <p>"Aye," Croft found his tongue. "Since it accords me the privilege of a
  further word with you."</p>

  <p>She drew her hand away. "Is a word with me of so great a value?" she
  questioned with a somewhat unsteady laugh.</p>

  <p>"To speak with Naia of Aphur I would dare death itself." Croft did not
  tell her how much he had already dared for that word indeed.</p>

  <p>"You are a bold man," she said, as he paused, and went on quickly. "Yet,
  since you value it so highly, forget not our invitation of this morning or
  that house in the mountains which is ours."</p>

  <p>"I shall not forget. Princess Naia," Croft replied. His brain was in a
  whirl. She had repeated the invitation. Did she really wish him to come? Had
  he read her glorious eyes aright? Had she sensed the truth as he had sensed
  it the first time he had seen her? Did she feel it? Did she know? Had the
  call of his spirit reached the spirit which was hers?</p>

  <p>Croft hardly believed that it had. He scarcely believed that her knowledge
  of that call was a definite thing as yet. Still, he was sure she felt
  something she herself could not wholly fathom&mdash;that her invitation was
  sincere, dictated by the call she as yet did not understand. Therefore he
  promised himself as well as her, to accept. And he vowed that before that
  visit to her mountain home was ended, she should recognize the truth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">XV. &mdash; THE MAN'S DEMAND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TOWARD that end and what it should finally bring about,
  Croft now made his plans. Kyphallos he learned would leave on the morrow for
  Scira, and as he knew would very shortly thereafter make that promised
  journey to Niera, where he would once more come under the attraction of the
  Zollarian Magnet&mdash;that tawny Kalamita who had attended the feast on
  Anthra before he started south.</p>

  <p>On the following day, therefore, he asked audience of Jadgor, took Robur
  with him when he appeared before the king and suggested the use of a spy on
  Cathur's heir, telling so much as he felt he dared, to support his plea.</p>

  <p>At first Jadgor was amazed. "How know you these things, Lord Jasor!" he
  cried.</p>

  <p>"I have heard things in the north," Croft replied without naming the
  location, letting Jadgor suppose it was during his days in Scira if he would.
  And it seemed that Jadgor did that very thing, since after a time he asked
  exactly what Jasor would propose.</p>

  <p>Croft suggested a consultation with Magur&mdash;and the sending of word to
  Abbu in the name of both Jasor and the Chief Priest of Himyra to see what
  Kyphallos did. That there was reason for his suggestion the very next day
  brought proof. A sailor from a Cathurian galley was found concealed in the
  shop where the new engines were being made. This following hard on the heels
  of Kyphallos's departure, Croft held suspicious indeed.</p>

  <p>He smiled in rather a grim way when Robur told him of the occurrence,
  rushing into the room where he sat engaged in the drawing of some further
  plans. But he took no steps save to have the sailor taken back to his ship
  and his captain cautioned to keep him out of harm's way, and to recommend
  that Robur place a guard about the shop. Indeed he was not greatly worried as
  he knew of one way in which he could watch Kyphallos and learn what he
  planned.</p>

  <p>On the sixth day, having seen the work on the engines well under way, he
  took the car, filled its tanks with spirits and drove out the north road
  toward that white palace in the mountains where he had been bidden as a
  guest.</p>

  <p>He had sent no word of his coming, yet he felt assured that a welcome
  would be his. There was a smile on his lips and a paean of joy in his heart
  as he stormed up the mountain grades and out across those gorges the road
  crossed on massive arches of stone.</p>

  <p>So at last he stopped before the steps leading up to the doors of the
  white Aphurian mansion, and sprang down. He mounted the steps and found once
  more the blue servant he had seen on another occasion, watching in awed
  expectancy just inside. To him he gave his title and asked for Naia
  herself.</p>

  <p>The blue man bowed. "She lies yonder. Lord," he replied. "I shall lead you
  to her."</p>

  <p>Following the servant. Croft came about a cluster of flowering bushes to
  find the hostess he sought.</p>

  <p>She lay upon a wine-red wood divan, while beside her sat the blue girl
  Maia, her supple body swinging in easy rhythm as she waved a fan for the
  comfort of the woman she served.</p>

  <p>By now Croft was fully accustomed to the disregard of clothing displayed
  by the Tamarizian servants and even the nobles themselves in their more
  private life.</p>

  <p>Hence he was not disturbed by the fact that Maia's well-turned torso
  swayed before him unclothed, or surprised that, since she knew not of his
  coming, no more than a tissue so sheer that the flesh beneath it lent it
  color, draped Naia's perfect form as she rose to stand before him and stretch
  forth her hands.</p>

  <p>"My Lord, Jasor," she exclaimed. "Your coming is as unexpected as welcome.
  Would you feel flattered were I to confess that I was thinking of you before
  you appeared?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, not flattered, but filled with a delight beyond words and a fear
  lest I deserve less than that!" Croft smiled, as he took her warm flesh in
  his hands and, gazing down into her eyes, found in their wide opened purple
  depths no surprise or startled question, but only pleasure as it seemed to
  him then.</p>

  <p>Hupor, the great hound-like beast who had been lying beside the two women,
  rose and, lifting himself upon his massive haunches, laid his fore-paws on
  Croft's shoulder and stared into his face.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Hupor gives you his favor, granted a few. Remove your cuirass and
  rest," Naia said resuming her seat and signing the Mazzerian to assist her
  guest. Then as he slipped out of the metal harness and stood in the soft
  shirt beneath it, she invited him to a place at her side and directed both
  servants to withdraw.</p>

  <p>"You are come for the promised visit?" she began when they sat alone.</p>

  <p>"If the time fits in with your convenience," Croft replied.</p>

  <p>Naia looked down at her sandalless feet, high-arched and pink of nail.</p>

  <p>"I will be frank," she went on. "I have been piqued because you delayed
  your coming." She glanced up with a little laugh.</p>

  <p>"And I that I could not come the sooner," Croft blended his laughter with
  hers.</p>

  <p>"You came in your car?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she said, and laid a hand on his arm. "My father declares that
  Jadgor thinks you inspired of Zitu to make Tamarizia great. Tell me, about
  these moturs and your work."</p>

  <p>Next to his love, these things were first in Croft's mind. For an hour he
  talked to the girl at his side. And he talked well. Her presence fired him,
  loosened his tongue. He painted for her a picture of Aphurian transportation
  transformed, of motors filling the highways, of motor-driven ships on river
  and sea, and swept on by his own conceptions spoke of motors as possible
  things of the air.</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" she cried. "My lord would dare what none save the birds dare
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Even so,", said Croft. "So shall Aphur become strong&mdash;stronger than
  any other State of Tamarizia&mdash;strong enough to guard the western gate
  without another's aid."</p>

  <p>He had made the remark of deliberate purpose, and now he heard the girl
  beside him catch her breath, and glancing toward her, found her eyes wide and
  very, very dark, with a strange light in their depths.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;my Lord Jasor, you can do this thing?"</p>

  <p>"And will," he declared.</p>

  <p>He saw Naia of Aphur quiver. "One who did that might ask what he would,
  and receive it of the State," she said slowly; and then once more her fingers
  touched his arm and he found them icy cold. "My lord, does Zitu answer
  prayers?"</p>

  <p>Croft's mind leaped swiftly from her words to a night when he had seen her
  kneeling before the figure of Azil in this self-same house&mdash;when he had
  heard her plea, lifted out of an anguished spirit&mdash;to the One Eternal
  Source. "What mean you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"If one&mdash;in sore trouble&mdash;one with a spirit which rebelled at a
  task to which it was set should cry for aid, would Zitu give heed?"</p>

  <p>O girl of gold, sang the heart in Croft's breast&mdash;O wonder-woman of
  all the universe of life! How well he knew her meaning. How well he sensed
  that in his words of promise for a future strength in her nation which would
  render needless her living immolation on the altar of patriotic duty, she saw
  a possible answer to that prayer she had lifted to Zitu, and Ga, and Azil the
  Giver of Life, And, how he longed to turn and sweep her supple form into his
  arms, crush it against his breast and speak to her soul the words which
  should assure her that he stood even now between her and the coming fate she
  loathed.</p>

  <p>As it was he sought to reassure by his reply. "Yes, Naia of Aphur, I think
  that indeed Zitu hears a troubled spirit's prayer. As for the form his answer
  may take&mdash;what man knows?"</p>

  <p>Her lips parted. "Aye, who knows," she repeated. "How long a time shall it
  require to bring these things to pass?"</p>

  <p>"They shall be Aphur's before a cycle has run out," said Croft.</p>

  <p>"Zitu! Then&mdash;then Aphur shall be strong beyond Jadgor's dreams
  ere&mdash;ere so short a time is gone!"</p>

  <p>Again Croft's heart pounded in his breast. Almost she had said ere she was
  forced into hated wedlock with Kyphallos, he thought. He inclined his
  head.</p>

  <p>"But why," Naia went on more calmly, "being of Nodhur, did you come with
  these plans to Aphur, my lord?"</p>

  <p>"You have said it." Croft turned to face her fully.</p>

  <p>"I?" She drew herself a trifle back as in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Because I am your lord." Croft did not hesitate now.</p>

  <p>And suddenly he saw once more that strange, startled look of half
  recognition which had leaped at him over the rim of the silver goblet the
  night of the betrothal feast.</p>

  <p>"My lord?" Naia began and faltered and came to a pause.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;yours." Croft bent toward her. "Because I knew of you&mdash;,
  and so knowing, knew you the one woman in all Tamarizia, or in all the worlds
  Zitu has made, whom I wished to possess as wife. Because I love you, Naia,
  Princess of Aphur. Because you are mine, and I yours, and have been since
  Zitu himself sent our two souls to dwell in the flesh. Because your flesh
  cries to mine, your soul calls to mine, your spirit seeks to be one with
  mine, as mine with yours. Therefore, forgetting caste and all else, came I to
  Aphur and to you. Caste I have overridden and risen above. Think you I shall
  let Cathur stand between me and the heaven of your lips, the soft prison of
  your arms?"</p>

  <p>For one wild instant while he spoke he thought her about to answer word
  for word. For she smiled. The thing started in her eyes and spread in a slow,
  divine wonder to her lips. Then, she sprang swiftly to her feet and faced him
  tensely erect, both voice and figure vibrant as she cried: "Stop! Jasor of
  Nodhur, you forget yourself. Think you so lightly of my plighted word, that
  you dare to address me thus? To Cathur I am pledged. To a maid of
  Tamarizia&mdash;or a woman of my house, and to all the courts of our nation
  that promise is sacred, not to be broken or put aside, save by an act of Zitu
  himself&mdash;save it be broken by death."</p>

  <p>Croft had risen, too. "An act of Zitu," he said as she paused. "And may
  not my coming to Aphur in itself be an answer to your prayer for deliverance
  from the embraces of Cathur's unworthy heir?"</p>

  <p>"My prayer?" Some of the resentful tension left Naia's form. "What know
  you&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I know much," Croft cut her short. "Am I dull of comprehension not to
  sense the name of her who prayed to Zitu in her travail? And what should
  wring such prayers from your flower-sweet breast, save that defilement it is
  planned to bring about, to add to Aphur's strength?"</p>

  <p>Once more she flamed before him. "Were I to speak your words to Lakkon or
  to Jadgor, it would mean your death," she hissed.</p>

  <p>"Then speak them&mdash;if you wish, beloved." Croft smiled.</p>

  <p>As quickly as she had threatened, she drooped now at his words. Something
  akin to fear came into her eyes. "Who are you&mdash;" she began in the voice
  of a child.</p>

  <p>"One who loves you," said Croft. "Who has loved you always&mdash;, who
  always will. One whom you love&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hold!" Once more she checked him. But he shook his head. "What need of
  the sacrifice&mdash;when I shall give Aphur and all Tamarizia that strength
  they would purchase now with you?"</p>

  <p>"Yet for that strength your price would be the same."</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;" Croft denied, "unless it were paid gladly."</p>

  <p>"And if it were not?"</p>

  <p>"Still would I give Tamarizia strength."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Naia of Aphur smiled. To Croft it seemed that she was well
  pleased with his answer. But barely had her lips parted as though for some
  further reply, than the Mazzerian passed toward the outer doors of the
  court.</p>

  <p>The princess's whole expression altered. "My father comes. I cannot speak
  further concerning this matter now. Did he dream of our discussion, there
  would be no bounds to his wrath. Did he know that I could consider such
  things, Zitu himself might not quench his rage."</p>

  <p>"Yet will you consider them, my Naia. You will give me an answer."</p>

  <p>"Later," she told him quickly. "I&mdash;we may not discuss it further now,
  my lord."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">XVI. &mdash; THE WOWAN'S ANSWER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HOURS later Croft looked from the windows of his room. The
  evening had been spent in a far more formal fashion than the late afternoon.
  Lakkon had come in. He had welcomed his guest. Naia had gone to her rooms to
  dress for the evening meal. They had dined. Over the meal Croft had described
  again his plans, to the flattering attention of his host. Naia had lingered
  with them for a time, now and then meeting Croft's glance with a smile of her
  crimson lips before she had gone to her room.</p>

  <p>Now as he leaned from his window he found all the garden beneath him, the
  mountain valley, the lake flooded in the light of the Palosian moons. The
  night called to him, and his heart was too full, his brain too busy with
  thought, to feel the spell of sleep. Drawing back he left his apartment,
  passed down the balcony corridor to the small door giving onto the garden
  stair and ran quickly down. The breath of flowering shrubs was about him.
  Light and shadow filled the place with a quiet beauty. Choosing a path which
  ran off before him he strolled along. So by degrees he approached the white
  walls of the garden bath, doubly white now in the night. And having
  approached them he paused. The sound of a gentle splashing came from
  within.</p>

  <p>Croft smiled. Another had felt the call of the outside world beside
  himself, and surely he felt that he knew who that one was.</p>

  <p>"Princess," he called softly, from beside the entrance screen.</p>

  <p>"Aye." The word came as soft as his own and was followed by a gentle
  laugh. "Wait, Jasor of Nodhur." There came a louder sound of movement,
  followed by a silence, and then: "And now my lord you may come."</p>

  <p>Croft passed the screen. The maiden stood before him. Her hair was coiled
  about her head. Her shoulder and arms showed glistening in the moonlight from
  the moisture of her skin.</p>

  <p>"Naia," said the man.</p>

  <p>"My lord." She smiled.</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;call me Jasor at least," he returned.</p>

  <p>"Jasor," said she.</p>

  <p>They were alone&mdash;a man and a maid. The white walls of the bath shut
  them in from all prying eyes. The pool lay silvered by the moonlight beneath
  them. And suddenly, Croft reached out toward her and swept her into his
  arms.</p>

  <p>That bold spirit which was his brooked no longer delay. He drew her to
  him. His arms sensed the lithe coolness of her figure as its dampness struck
  through the single garment, hastily donned at his call. So he held her and
  sensed all her maddening presence.</p>

  <p>"Mine!" he cried, pressing her closer in the circle of his arms. "Mine!
  Woman whom Zitu himself has made for me."</p>

  <p>"Hush." Her hand fell over his lips, and he felt her tremble. "Jasor, how
  knew you I was here?"</p>

  <p>"I knew not until the night called me into the garden and I heard the
  sound of the water," he replied. "Then your presence told me of itself and I
  spoke your name."</p>

  <p>There was a stone seat at one end of the pool. She led him there and
  seated herself at his side. "You are bold," she said, speaking quickly.
  "Jasor, I came here to think&mdash;as I have thought ever since we spoke
  together today."</p>

  <p>"And having thought, will you give me my answer now?"</p>

  <p>She lifted her eyes, dark in the silver night. "Can you truly do those
  things you spoke of?" she questioned him again as she had questioned
  before.</p>

  <p>"Do you doubt it?" he questioned in reply.</p>

  <p>"Nay, I think not. You would do all you say&mdash;for me?"</p>

  <p>"All and more, for you, or to save you a sorrow," Croft said.</p>

  <p>"Think you," said she, "that Kyphallos of Aphur is aught to me?"</p>

  <p>"No," Croft laughed. "I know you hate him. Princess&mdash;name him the
  beast he is."</p>

  <p>"You know much," she said in response and her voice was vibrant with a
  tone he had never heard her use before. "Yet things there may be you know not
  of. Listen, my lord. My lips touched not the wine in the silver goblet the
  night of the betrothal feast."</p>

  <p>"Naia!" Croft came to his feet. Naia of Aphur rose also. Her eyes were
  stars in the night. She stood before him a slender, swaying shape. She put
  forth her hands. "My eyes looked into yours above the goblet," she said
  softly, still in that strange new tone. "They forbade my lips to drink.
  Hence, Jasor, this is my answer&mdash;I am yours can you win me in time."</p>

  <p>And now she came into his arms of her own volition. Croft found her upon
  his breast, clinging to him with her slender hands, looking up into his face.
  Some way his face sank to meet hers. Some way his mouth found her lips.</p>

  <p>Then she had torn her mouth away. "Zitu, what have I done?" she cried. "No
  maid of Aphur may touch the lips of a man not of her blood, unless she is his
  bride. But-but&mdash;this thing is stronger than I. Days span the time since
  I have known you, yet Zitu knows it seems I have known you always&mdash;have
  waited for you to come, and knew it not, until that night when your glance
  met mine and told me I was yours. Jasor of Nodhur, you must save me&mdash;win
  me&mdash;now."</p>

  <p>"Aye, I shall win you." Once more Croft claimed her lips and she did not
  resist. A mad exaltation filled him. He had won&mdash;Naia of Aphur. She lay
  in his arms. She had given him more than a maid of her race had any right to
  give according to convention's code. No question then but that her heart
  which beat so wildly against his breast, beat with the pulse of love. He had
  won&mdash;and he would win, not only this, but all that she could give.</p>

  <p>"Swear it," she panted when once more her lips were free. "O Zitu, swear I
  shall be wholly yours. Think you I could yield to Kyphallos now? Nay&mdash;I
  had rather die."</p>

  <p>"I swear," said Croft. "And tomorrow I shall return to Himyra and my
  work."</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow." Disappointment rang in her tones. "When I have counted each
  day until you should come."</p>

  <p>"Himyra is not far in the car already made," Croft said ignoring her
  ingenuous confession. "I shall come to you again&mdash;aye, again and
  again."</p>

  <p>"Yet must we be discreet," Naia exclaimed. "You must come&mdash;I must see
  you&mdash;but we must keep this secret in our hearts. Did Lakkon dream that
  Naia had dared to break her spoken pledge&mdash;" She paused. A tremor shook
  her as she leaned against him with his arm about her waist.</p>

  <p>"You must return to your room," he urged. "Fear not. Yet when you pray,
  ask of Zitu that he give me speed and knowledge in my work. And should you
  not see or hear from me for a time, be sure that all I do is for you, that
  you are ever in my thoughts."</p>

  <p>"As you will be in mine." Once more she turned to face him. "Yet before I
  go in now, my lord, give me again your lips."</p>

  <p>"Beloved!" Croft held her a final moment and saw her depart.</p>

  <p>Himself he lingered by the pool. His soul was on fire. He had
  won&mdash;Naia of Aphur in her soul was his. The soft warmth of her lips
  still lingered upon his own. Aye, he had won&mdash;her surrender to himself.
  That final kiss showed how complete that surrender was. So complete was it,
  that she had overstepped all the code of her nation and caste in order to
  give it expression, had placed herself where, should her act be learned, she
  would stand before her people disgraced.</p>

  <p>Nor was his love less than hers. It was a great love, which had brought
  him to this time&mdash;so great, so all-compelling, he felt now that even in
  his student days in India it had drawn him in a strange, subconscious fashion
  not then understood&mdash;so great that for it he had dared the unknown, to
  find the feminine complement of his spirit, whom tonight he had held within
  his arms. No mere lure of the flesh was his divine passion, which had drawn
  him and fired him now to a resolution to work, work for it and it alone,
  until he had won not only Naia's love, but Naia as well. She had said the
  thing was stronger than herself. Croft knew it was stronger than himself as
  he sat beside the moonlit pool. It was one of those great loves, which have
  made history before this and will again. Hence tomorrow he would go back to
  Himyra, and there he would work and plan.</p>

  <p>And, thought Croft, he must spy upon Cathur's prince, in the way only he
  could compass so far as he knew. Kyphallos must be in Scira now, unless he
  had gone back to Anthra. Kyphallos must be watched. There was that trip to
  Niera he had promised Kalamita to make. Would he tell her what had occurred
  in Himyra? And if so, what would Zollaria's Magnet of white flesh do? That
  she felt any emotion for Kyphallos other than as a pawn to her hand. Croft
  did not believe. He knew her type, and frankly he believed her an agent of
  her nation set to ensnare the heir of Cathur and further Zollaria's plans. He
  nodded his head and rose. He would find this Cathurian prince and see what he
  did, and where at present he was.</p>

  <p>Quickly he went back to his own apartment and laid himself on the couch.
  Naia he fancied was lying so even now in that room where Azil lifted his
  carved white wings beside her mirror pool. He smiled. Some day he promised
  his heart, his empty arms, they should not lie apart, but together, on a
  moonlit Palosian night.</p>

  <p>Then he put all that out of his mind and fixed its full power on his task.
  Swiftly that conscious entity which was the real man flitted across the
  Central Sea, and found itself in the palace of Scythys, the Cathurian king.
  About it he prowled, invisible and unseen by the nodding palace guards. And
  in it he found no sign of Scythys's son.</p>

  <p>Once more he flitted free. To Abbu he went and found the monk asleep in a
  room of the Scira pyramid. And from there he flashed to Anthra, and found the
  gilded galley of the fickle youth tied up in the harbor basin, and Kyphallos
  lost in dalliance with a slender and beautiful dancer. He turned away with
  disgust; yet not before he learned that Kyphallos went to Niera tomorrow, as
  he had promised Kalamita he would do more than a month before.</p>

  <p>Back to his chamber and the body of Jasor of Nodhur went Croft. At least
  now he was satisfied that he could watch Kyphallos and mark his every move.
  Then let Kyphallos beware. He gave a final glance to the moon-flooded night
  and slept.</p>

  <p>And in the morning he entered the motor and ran back to Himyra before the
  heat of the day. Work&mdash;work. That was to be his motto for the golden
  days to come. But first he must again return to earth. That day, therefore,
  he spent in coaching Robur toward keeping the work moving on the engines.
  Also he requested that he have a great shop erected beyond the one they were
  using to expedite the work, and drew for him the plans for a sort of dock,
  wherein motors might be installed in a number of ships.</p>

  <p>"Why give these to me?" Robur asked after Croft had explained.</p>

  <p>"Since, that tonight, Rob, I shall fall into the sleep of which I have
  told you," Croft replied.</p>

  <p>"Zitu! You feel it upon you?" Robur half started back.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And it will last for how long a time?"</p>

  <p>"I know not," said Croft. "It shall endure until I am possessed of the
  next means for making Aphur strong. Do you remember your promise to guard my
  body well?"</p>

  <p>"It shall be well guarded, my strange friend," Robur promised again.</p>

  <p>Yet that night a sudden panic seized upon Croft. What, he asked himself,
  if some unknown peril should threaten Naia while he was studying
  munition-making on earth? He considered that for a time, before he saw a way
  around. And then he sought out Gaya, and finding her alone as luck would have
  it, explained to her as he had explained to Robur before the nature of his
  coming sleep.</p>

  <p>She heard him wide-eyed, and before she could break forth in comment Croft
  went on. "But Gaya, wife of my friend, should any peril or danger threaten
  Naia, daughter of Lakkon, the cousin of your lord, and I be still
  asleep&mdash;come quickly to me and bend to whisper, 'Naia needs you' and I
  promise I shall awake."</p>

  <p>Gaya gave him a wide-eyed, startled glance. "Her name will rouse you from
  this sleep of deathlike seeming?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Aye," Croft smiled. Gaya's expression had told him in a flash that she
  understood.</p>

  <p>"Wife of my friend, I think her name might wake me from death itself."</p>

  <p>"Jasor!" Gaya cried. "My lord&mdash;can this thing be?"</p>

  <p>"That my heart lies at her pink nailed feet?" Croft retorted. "Aye."</p>

  <p>"Yet is she pledged to Cathur." Gaya grew swiftly pale. "Jasor, my good
  lord&mdash;and you love her, speak not concerning it to any other save
  myself. I swear by Zitu to keep your words in my heart. Do you control your
  tongue."</p>

  <p>Croft smiled into her troubled face again. "My tongue I may control," he
  declared. "But my heart can I not curb in its mad passion for the maid, nor
  make it less rebel against this plighted troth."</p>

  <p>"Robur approves not of it, nor I," Gaya told him softly. "Love brought
  Milidhur and Aphur together. But&mdash;this&mdash;this of&mdash;of other
  design." And suddenly she knit her well-formed brows.</p>

  <p>"Jasor," said she speaking very quickly; "you are strong&mdash;you have
  thoughts above other men; and something tells me the maid would lie happy in
  your arms."</p>

  <p>Croft sprang to his feet. "You would approve it, Gaya, my sweet friend?"
  he exclaimed with flashing eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am a woman," she replied in almost breathless fashion. "Naia loathes
  this Cathurian prince."</p>

  <p>"And a cycle lies before us, ere he claims her for his own," Croft
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"What mean you?" Gaya half rose. Her hand lifted to her breast.</p>

  <p>"Nay." Croft shook his head. "I cannot tell you. Yet, as you say, I am
  strong, and I shall make Aphur and Tamarizia strong as myself and stronger a
  thousand-fold. Remember, therefore, the words I have told you to speak, and
  say them close in my ear, in case any need should arise."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">XVII. &mdash; THE TEUTONS IN THE SKY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NAIA! Naia of Aphur would lie happy in his arms. And by
  Zitu! Some day she should. This was for her. Croft laid himself on his couch
  and fell into that deathlike sleep of the body he had learned so well to
  produce.</p>

  <p>But his spirit fled across the Central Sea to Niera, willing itself into
  the presence of Cathur's heir wherever he might be.</p>

  <p>He found him in the room of a red stone palace overlooking the sea from
  the terraced side of the shore on which it stood. He lay on a copper couch,
  covered with silken cloth of a clear pure yellow, and he wore an expression
  of sullen pique upon his face.</p>

  <p>For he was not alone. Nor was this his private apartment as Croft
  understood in a glance. It was the suite of Kalamita herself. And the tawny
  beauty was present in quite shameless fashion, plainly preparing herself for
  some coming function as it appeared from the litter of feminine articles of
  toilet which lay on the red wood table at which she sat.</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;think you I have no other source of information beyond your own
  rosy lips, good Kyphallos," she broke forth in an almost taunting voice; "or
  that I know not men for what they are? This flower of Aphur is pretty as I
  have heard, as Bzad who has disguised him-elf and journeyed to Himyra as a
  common sailor and seen her, tells me of his own knowledge. Also it comes to
  my ears that you drank too deeply of the Aphurian wine. A drunkard and a
  pretty fleshly toy. Zitemque himself never fashioned a stronger design for
  the making of trouble, and fools. Think you I cannot understand?"</p>

  <p>Kyphallos frowned. "One would think you Gayana," he grumbled as Kalamita
  paused.</p>

  <p>She shrugged. "Nay, I am no priestess of Ga, nor a virgin as you know. Nor
  do I ask that you look no less clay [<i>sic</i>]. What are your pastimes with
  dancers and women of the people to me? Yet Kalamita gives not herself to be
  cast aside for a woman of Aphur's choosing&mdash;or a woman of equal
  rank."</p>

  <p>So that was it, thought Croft. Kyphallos was in this woman's power
  indeed.</p>

  <p>And now Kyphallos quitted his couch and crossed to her side. He caught her
  and raised her in his arms. "You are the fool!" he cried. "Yet by Zitu, I
  delight to see you heated, by word of another than yourself. Listen&mdash;and
  this time believe. I found myself in a trap of Jadgor's devising, as I have
  said. Had I refused this rite of betrothal, how think you he would have
  looked upon my act? Could I allay all suspicion of those things which shall
  bring you queen to Zitra's throne in better fashion than to accept?</p>

  <p>"Think not all the wisdom of mankind lies wrapped in your beauteous head.
  Kyphallos of Cathur is no more a fool than another. Hence I stand pledged to
  Naia, of Aphur, whom Bzad himself may have for a toy, should he wish, so long
  as I keep Kalamita in my arms! Thus have I gained the time of a cycle for the
  further perfecting of my plans."</p>

  <p>"This is the truth?" A flash of selfish satisfaction crept into the
  woman's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;as I tell you. Small need of your spies in Aphur to bring you
  word. Myself, I left a spy to find out the secret of this new car which runs
  itself, as I told you. Aye&mdash;Cathur, too, knows how to plan."</p>

  <p>Croft felt a thrill of humor at the words. He knew well what had happened
  to Cathur's spy. He watched while Kalamita freed herself from Kyphallos's
  embrace and began loading herself with jewels.</p>

  <p>"And how does Cathur plan when the cycle is run out?" she inquired at
  length. "What of this pledge with Aphur, then?"</p>

  <p>"Zollaria will be ready then," Kyphallos said.</p>

  <p>Zollaria would be ready. The thing was plotted then, arranged. There was a
  full understanding between Kyphallos and the nation which had used this
  beautiful vampire to bait its trap.</p>

  <p>"And if not?" she said.</p>

  <p>"The pledge can be forsworn&mdash;and Aphur can do what she likes."</p>

  <p>"Your father?"</p>

  <p>"Knows not his own mind from day to day, as you yourself know. Even now he
  speaks of giving me the throne." Kalamita smiled.</p>

  <p>"Yet Bzad says Naia is very fair." She narrowed her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Bzad speaks truth, yet have I not come straight to you as I said on my
  return?"</p>

  <p>"Aye. Good then, my lord. Tonight let us speak as one of this journey to
  the south. Myself, I shall seem as one who knows and understands, and am
  satisfied in all that has occurred. Do you maintain your action solely to
  gain time and allay all suspicion in Aphur's mind. Tonight shall you know
  Zollaria's final plans which shall bring you to Zitra's throne."</p>

  <p>She rose and stood before him. "Do you love me indeed, my lord?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, by Zitu!" Kyphallos's voice was thickened. He reached out eager
  hands. But Kalamita laughed. "Not Kyphallos alone may pledge himself for
  reasons of State," she taunted, drawing back. "I also have given my troth to
  another since you left."</p>

  <p>"You!" For an instant the Cathurian seemed bereft of further power of
  speech. He grew deadly pale. Then the red blood surged back into his face. It
  grew dark, with a deadly passion. He sprang forward and seized her by her
  jewel-banded arms, holding her in a grip she might not resist.</p>

  <p>"What mean you? Say quickly your words are a jest, or, by Zitu and Azil,
  you shall find no time before I crush in your unfaithful breast!"</p>

  <p>It came over Croft that the Cathurian loved her&mdash;with such love as a
  man of his type could give; that for her he was ready to sacrifice honor and
  country and all a true man would hold sacred; that this explained all he had
  so far heard. And it came into his mind that the woman was in danger. But she
  smiled in mockery into the threatening face.</p>

  <p>"For reasons of State, my lord," she said.</p>

  <p>"What?" Kyphallos caught a breath. Kalamita loosened his grip on her arms,
  carried his arms downward beside her and drew them about her form.</p>

  <p>"Plans have gone forward since you departed for the south. When all is
  ready you shall invite me to Anthra&mdash;and once in your power you shall
  refuse to permit my return. Zollaria, and he to whom I am pledged, shall
  demand it, and still shall you refuse. Then shall Zollaria wage war on Cathur
  and Cathur shall appeal to Tamarizia for aid. And since Cathur guards the
  gate to the Central Sea and her loss would spell the downfall of a thousand
  cycles of power that aid may not be refused."</p>

  <p>The rape of Helen&mdash;the siege of Troy. Woman&mdash;woman&mdash;the
  source of life and the cause of so much death. Croft felt his senses swirl as
  he saw the subtle way in which nothing less than a war of conquest had been
  planned and practically assured.</p>

  <p>Kyphallos spoke. "And Cathur's unprepared army, thanks to Tamhys's
  thoughts of peace, and of others before him, shall scarcely stop the armies
  Zollaria has trained and armed and taught for fifty years. Then shall
  Kyphallos and Kalamita mount the throne of Zitra, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Naia!" Once more the woman taunted with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Bzad can have her, if he takes her," Kyphallos cried.</p>

  <p>Bzad&mdash;the blue Mazzerian chief! Naia to a savage! Croft's spirit
  quivered and shook with a righteous rage. The last vestige of any compunction
  he might have held against leading the girl to declare her passion for
  himself disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Not an impossible fate," he heard Kalamita speaking and noted a crafty
  light creep into her yellow eyes. "Come, then. Let us descend. Play your part
  strongly, my lord, and all, I think, shall be well."</p>

  <p>Croft followed them downstairs to the court where a table was spread. Save
  Kalamita herself the guests were wholly men. He recognized Bandhor, her
  brother, and the Mazzerian Bzad. The others, plainly Zollarians and men of
  Mazzer by their appearance and speech, were as yet unknown to him.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the Zollarian Magnet and her captive victim was a signal
  for all to take their seats. Thereafter, as the meal progressed, Croft
  learned the final details of the plan.</p>

  <p>It was mainly such as he had already conceived, save that the Mazzerian
  nation was to aid Zollaria in the war of annexation she planned. For this
  Mazzeria was to be given a seaport on the Central Sea and free use of a river
  leading from it through the state of Bithur, as well as the eastern half of
  Bithur itself. War would be made by Mazzeria on the eastern frontier, while
  Zollaria threw her main force against Cathur and crushed her smaller army by
  sheer force of weight.</p>

  <p>"Thus," said one of the party, a man unknown to Croft, yet one, he felt,
  could be no less than a representative of the Zollarian ruler himself from
  the deference paid him by the others, "shall Zollaria make good that freedom
  of the seas she has long desired, and prove her good faith and her friendship
  for our Mazzerian allies to the east. Thus shall Zollaria and Tamarizia
  become one nation, with Cathur to rule the southern half. As for the fashion
  in which our good Prince Kyphallos met Aphur's plans, it is well. For since
  war is to be the outcome of all our planning, what matters one pledge broken
  more or less?"</p>

  <p>This was Zollarian statecraft. Croft thought. This was the weight of
  Zollaria's word. This was the right of might. To take what she wished, to
  trick, betray, seduce, that she might gain her ends thereby. Nothing which
  mankind held sacred was sacred to her, it appeared. She sent a royal woman of
  easy morals to lure Cathur into a snare. She would make this tawny
  enchantress her final excuse for war. She was callous, overbearing, greedy of
  power, gross save for a surface seeming of culture she used as a mask&mdash;
  behind which lurked the true nature which inspired her plans and acts. To her
  Kyphallos would sell his birthright, his state, his nation, for the favor of
  the wanton beside him and a place upon a secondary throne.</p>

  <p>And it was Kyphallos who spoke now.</p>

  <p>"And thus shall Kalamita be queen at Zitra when all is done! A toast to
  Kalamita now!"</p>

  <p>"To Kalamita, queen of women now. Queen of Zitra later!" the unknown noble
  cried and lifted a goblet brimming with wine.</p>

  <p>"To Kalamita!" the party drank.</p>

  <p>"And now," said the unknown, rising and lifting the goblet above his head,
  "another toast, my friends. To those things we have planned and their
  fruition. To&mdash;the day&mdash;whenever it shall be!"</p>

  <p>"To the day!" They drank it standing.</p>

  <p>Bandhor, in whose palace Croft judged the conference has occurred, clapped
  his hands sharply and a band of dancers trooped in.</p>

  <p>Croft left. He had learned all he had hoped and more. He knew now what
  Tamarizia faced&mdash;war. And he knew more. He knew that Naia, of Aphur, was
  his! He knew that Cathur meant to forswear her&mdash;that there would be no
  need on his part to win her other than by winning this war. His part now to
  arm Aphur, Nodhur, Milidhur&mdash;so much of Tamarizia as he could in the
  space of a year. His part to bring disaster to these carefully laid plans of
  a greedy nation and a traitor prince.</p>

  <p>That was his work. It was best he should be about it. To do what he must
  the time was painfully short. Turning his mind upon the first step which
  should lead him to its completion, he focused his mind upon it with all his
  power and left Palos for the earth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; "ARMS AND THE MAN"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TWO weeks went by before he once more opened the eyes of
  Jasor's body and found himself in a guarded room in the palace of Aphur's
  king.</p>

  <p>He had spent them on earth in the study of firearms and munitions and the
  various devices required for making the same. Now he returned with a
  consciousness full of designs and an urgent desire to attempt their carrying
  out.</p>

  <p>He sat up. "List, soldier, I would drink!" he announced.</p>

  <p>The guard inside the door of his chamber started, shot a quick glance
  toward his bed, and approached none too swiftly, Croft thought. The man
  actually seemed afraid.</p>

  <p>"Wine!" he snapped, seeking to overcome the first shock induced by his
  words.</p>

  <p>"Aye, my lord." The guard turned to the door and set it open. "Wine!" he
  bawled. "The Lord Jasor awakes!"</p>

  <p>"My clothes." Croft left his couch.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later a rap fell on the door. Robur appeared. Word of Croft's
  waking had spread. The prince himself came with a page bringing wine. Croft
  drank: "I would see Jadgor at once," he declared.</p>

  <p>"He sleeps," Prince Robur began.</p>

  <p>"Then wake him. All Tamarizia totters to a fall unless we be ready in less
  than a single cycle, Rob."</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" Robur stared. "Say you truly? How know you this, Jasor, my
  friend?"</p>

  <p>Croft turned and pointed toward his couch. "I was told while my body lay
  there," he said quickly. "You call on Zitu in vain unless you give heed to my
  words!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, not so. Come," replied Aphur's prince. "I myself shall take you to
  my father without delay."</p>

  <p>That was a strange night in Himyra of Aphur, pregnant with the destinies
  of a nation&mdash;and nothing less. Jadgor, no king in seeming now, but a
  stern-faced man in a simple garment sat upon his couch while Croft revealed
  his knowledge of what Zollaria planned.</p>

  <p>"By Zitu!" he roared at the end, "would Cathur dare this thing?"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;for the woman and Zitra's throne," said Croft.</p>

  <p>"To forswear his pledge to Aphur?"</p>

  <p>"Aye."</p>

  <p>"To surrender his state?"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;that too, Jadgor the king."</p>

  <p>And suddenly Jadgor was king indeed despite the disadvantage of position
  and clothes. "Then let Zilla the Destroyer take me unless we meet them, spear
  to spear and sword to sword! Jasor of Nodhur, I understand you not&mdash;nor
  yet how your knowledge is obtained save Zitu speaks through you as a
  mouthpiece for his own designs. Yet know I that what you say falls out.
  Wherefore I shall once more heed your words. This falls on Aphur, Nodhur,
  Milidhur, I think, with Tamhys, man of peace on Zitra's throne. Yet shall
  Aphur, Nodhur, and Milidhur prepare. Inside a cycle, should we work together,
  we shall have a very horde of ready spears and swords."</p>

  <p>"Nay, scarcely that," said Croft.</p>

  <p>"What else?" Jadgor stared.</p>

  <p>"Stronger weapons than those, for which I bring the plans. If made in
  time, a thousand men instructed in their use, can end this war almost before
  it starts. Let Aphur, Milidhur, and Nodhur plan together, that these weapons
  may be produced&mdash;some in Himyra and some in Ladhra. The work is vast.
  Yet shall the final end be sure if this is done before Zollaria strikes.
  Robur and I shall undertake the carrying out of my designs, if Jadgor gives
  the word."</p>

  <p>"Then Jadgor gives it," said the king. "On Nodhur will I call and
  Milidhur. No man may say that Aphur failed to think of Tamarizia's good. For
  though I see that should you do this thing your name will stand above all
  others in the state&mdash;I love my nation more than I love either fame or
  rank. Hence, Nodhur, make your weapons for this coming trial of strength, and
  I shall give you moneys, metals, men&mdash;all things, you may require."</p>

  <p>Croft's heart swelled in his breast. Had he ever doubted Jadgor's
  patriotic motives for a moment, those doubts died now as he heard him lay
  aside those dreams of imperial rank he knew had once been his. And in that
  moment there was born within his brain the plan he was fated to carry
  out&mdash;a plan which would make Tamhys the last emperor of Tamarizia, and
  after him no other ever again.</p>

  <p>"Then," he accepted the king's assurance, "Robur and I shall plan that
  this work may start at once. Aphur, I crave your pardon for having broken
  your sleep."</p>

  <p>That was the beginning of Croft's real work. Oddly enough, on a planet
  where he had come upon seeming peace, his first task outside the original
  motor was in preparing for war; and even the motor entered largely into
  that.</p>

  <p>At once he plunged into a very frenzy of action, almost appalled himself
  by the amount to be done inside a year. That first night he spent with Robur
  drafting to his attentive ears those things which they must do&mdash;the
  finishing of the motors&mdash;their installation in ships.</p>

  <p>"The structure for that end is well-nigh completed," Robur said.</p>

  <p>"Good!" Croft cried, and went on swiftly to demand the construction or
  appropriation of buildings for the making of arms. As to the nature of the
  latter, he held back the details for the time and spoke of preparing a fleet
  of swift motor-driven galleys in which to transport the troops they would
  raise across the Central Sea when the need should arise.</p>

  <p>Robur's eyes sparkled at that. "We shall come upon them ere they dream we
  can arrive. Jasor, my friend, your name shall be greatest among Tamarizia's
  men."</p>

  <p>"No greater than that of Jadgor," Croft replied. "Rob, your father is a
  man above other men. None save a man of noble spirit forgets himself to
  assure his nation's good."</p>

  <p>In the month that followed Croft did many things. He began the training of
  a number of men in assembling the motors, choosing only such as seemed
  peculiarly adapted to the work. He installed a motor in a galley and drove
  the craft through Himyra along the Na at a speed which had never been seen in
  a ship in Palos before. In this, with Jadgor himself and Lakkon, whom he
  persuaded to bring Naia along, he journeyed on up the river to make his
  long-promised visit to Jasor's parents at Ladhra and enlist Belzor, King of
  Nodhur, in their plans.</p>

  <p>Sinon and Mellia scarcely knew how to take him they thought their son.</p>

  <p>"By Zitu! You have done it!" Sinon cried as he rode the galley across the
  Na's yellow flood.</p>

  <p>Later, loaded with honors, both by Jadgor and Belzor himself, he grew
  abashed.</p>

  <p>"That my son should raise me to noble station," he faltered to Mellia at
  his side. "Strange days are coming to Tamarizia, wife of my heart, when he
  who was a dullard sits in the council of the kings."</p>

  <p>For Croft had appeared before Belzor inside the first day after Ladhra was
  reached. And Belzor, startled by the fact of a galley which ran up the turgid
  current of the mighty river without oars or sails, had listened to him and
  Jadgor and joined his support to their plans. That settled, he arranged with
  Sinon to send several galleys to Himyra to be equipped with motors, and
  returning to that city for a few days, dropped downstream, entered the
  Central Sea, and sailed to the capital city of Milidhur.</p>

  <p>On this trip Gaya made one of their party, and though Croft perforce acted
  as engineer, he managed more than one word with Naia during the course of the
  voyage, and once the fleeting bliss of a stolen kiss.</p>

  <p>In Milidhur, Gaya's voice helped to turn the tide to Jadgor and Croft. A
  princess of state, she brought all her influence to bear. And since Milidhur
  was asked only to form a part of the army, to be equipped before Zollaria
  struck, the matter was soon arranged.</p>

  <p>Back in Himyra at length. Croft found the work on the motors progressing
  swiftly under Robur's direction and at once began the actual construction of
  machines for the fashioning of arms. Now and then he stole away for an
  evening and drove out to Lakkon's mountain palace for a meal. Not only did he
  find pleasure in the going, but Naia pleaded for the all too short hours they
  managed to spend together, and to Croft it seemed, that each time he brought
  back from her presence a freshened and driving energy to his work.</p>

  <p>That work progressed. Of that progress he spoke to her from time to time.
  And always she spurred him on with eyes and lips through the task at the end
  of which she herself was the waiting and willing prize.</p>

  <p>DAY and night the fire of creation flared in Himyra, and so soon as work
  was started, and he had shown Robur how to keep busy the many men Jadgor had
  furnished for their needs. Croft put some of the new motors into commission
  between Himyra and Ladhra and started other work there, in a mighty building
  set apart by Belzor for his use. Those necessary bits of machinery first
  installed in the Himyra shops he had made, like the motor parts were now
  made, in numbers. Sinon's first galley up the Na carried as its cargo
  partly-assembled engines of queer design to a Palosian mind, which should
  when set up in the shops at Ladhra fulfil their portion of Croft's plan.</p>

  <p>Thereafter the fires of the new era flared in Ladhra, too, and Croft spent
  his time between the two shops, motoring back and forth mainly at night,
  regardless of the loss of sleep until he should have everything running
  smoothly.</p>

  <p>Twenty of the hundred cars which were gradually taking shape he set apart,
  however, after they were tested&mdash;and these he had equipped with
  all-metal wheels carrying cross-bars on their tires like short, strong teeth.
  He put workmen to the task of making metal walls to bolt upon each chassis.
  And these walls were pierced with slots. Thus he arranged for twenty armored
  cars and had them set aside.</p>

  <p>Likewise he speeded the construction of numbers of flat-bottomed
  power-boats capable of speed, yet having floor space enough to transport no
  small number of men.</p>

  <p>A month passed, two months, three. Always the fires in Ladhra and Himyra
  flared. Men toiled day and night. Croft's plans were drawn for each part of
  the army he intended to make. Machines were assembled and set up&mdash;motors
  were harnessed to them to Robur's amazement. Croft found the Tamarizians apt
  of comprehension and willing to work. Each man employed was sworn to fealty
  to the State. Each knew himself a member in an army working for the safety of
  the nation. At the end of three months he found himself the supreme captain
  of a picked corps. And at the end of a month he was ready to begin the actual
  making of arms.</p>

  <p>Now and then Croft went back to his earthly body, not only to renew its
  physical life, but to gain help in the work he was carrying on by learning
  fresh details on each trip. He gave up any intention of manufacturing
  machine-guns, as a thing requiring too much time. On an average he spent two
  days of every week on earth. His sleeps on Palos had become too frequent to
  cause any further comment when they occurred.</p>

  <p>Thus a fourth month passed. In it Croft accomplished several things. He
  did not stop motor production with the first hundred. He continued their
  building and began selling the output of the shops to private owners. The
  things became a not too unusual sight on the Himyra streets, and the first
  motor caravan was organized and crossed the inland desert to Milidhur with
  success.</p>

  <p>One special car Croft had built. On it he lavished all his present ability
  of refinement. And when it was done he drove it to Lakkon's mountain mansion
  in the twilight of a busy day. It was for Naia, and himself he gave it to
  her, and after the evening meal when the three moons rose he placed her in it
  and taught her how to drive.</p>

  <p>Far down the mountain road and out upon the desert between the foot of the
  hills and Himyra they went. They were alone in the soft light which turned
  the dun plain to silver. Far off the red fires in Croft's workshops flared
  over Himyra's walls.</p>

  <p>Croft stopped the car and pointed to that red reflection in the lesser
  light. Suddenly it seemed to him that in all the world there were just they
  two&mdash;that they were alone&mdash;that nothing else mattered. His heart
  swelled.</p>

  <p>"For you!" he said, and drew Naia into his arms, and against his breast.
  "For you!"</p>

  <p>He kissed her on eyes and lips. "To free you and give you to me always.
  Those fires are burning away all need of your sacrifice. In the end they
  shall make you mine."</p>

  <p>"Yours." Naia sighed in his arms as one content. "Here in the desert you
  preserved my life. Why should it not belong to you?</p>

  <p>"Your work progresses well?" she went on after a time.</p>

  <p>"Beyond my hopes," Croft assured her. "Have no fear. All shall be
  ready&mdash;in time."</p>

  <p>"My lord;" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;<i>your</i> lord, beloved," said Croft.</p>

  <p>"Beloved," she repeated.</p>

  <p>For a time Croft simply held her, and then he turned the car and drove
  back up the mountain road.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">XIX. &mdash; A SUMMONS FROM ZITRA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AT the end of the fourth month the first rifle was done. It
  was ah odd-appearing affair. Tempered copper took the place of earthly steel
  in barrel and other metal parts. Copper formed the shell for the ammunition,
  over which Croft had experienced more trouble than in anything else. Lead was
  very scarce on Palos. But there were vast quantities of gold. That explained
  the enormous use made of it in draperies and the common trades as he had
  learned.</p>

  <p>Yet it was with some compunction due to the opposite conditions on earth
  and their life-long effect on his brain that he finally hit on an alloy from
  which the bullets were made. Powder had troubled him, too&mdash;though in the
  end he managed to make it. And for the fulminating centers of his cartridge
  complete, he was compelled to spend several days on earth.</p>

  <p>In the end, however, he held the first completed weapon in his hands and
  gloated over its finished lines. Taking Robur in a car, he drove out along
  the south road to a place where he knew vast flocks of water-fowl were wont
  to frequent the Na.</p>

  <p>As a boy he had been a good shot, until such time as he waked in his soul
  a repugnance for killing the natural creatures the One Great Source had made,
  save as necessity arose.</p>

  <p>He gestured to the wild fowl floating on the yellow water more than a
  bow-shot away. "Now watch, Rob," he said, and took the rifle in his
  hands.</p>

  <p>Vaguely by now Prince Robur understood the design of the new instrument of
  destruction. Yet it was hard for him to comprehend fully a thing such as he
  had never dreamed before Croft put it into his mind. He smiled. "Had we not
  better draw a little closer, Jasor, my friend?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"No." On the word Croft fired. Nor did he fire blindly into the flock. He
  chose a bird swimming to one side. And hard on the sound of his shot that
  bird jerked in the spasmodic fashion of a sorely stricken thing, struggled
  for an instant and floated away, half sunk in the yellow tide.</p>

  <p>The entire flock rose at the new strange sound on the silent air. They
  swarmed across the sky. Pumping up a fresh cartridge. Croft lifted his rifle
  swiftly, chanced another hit&mdash;and scored. One of the flying creatures
  checked its rapid course, slanted drunkenly downward and then spun dizzily
  over and over to fall not far from where the two men stood in the car.</p>

  <p>"Zitu! Zitu!" Robur exclaimed, springing from the machine to retrieve the
  fallen bird. Croft watched him run toward it in very unprincelike haste. Then
  he was coming back with the dead thing in his hands, staring wide-eyed at the
  drops of blood on its feathers, lifting his face with a strange expression to
  Croft, as he climbed back to his seat.</p>

  <p>"Are you convinced, Rob?" Croft laid the rifle aside.</p>

  <p>"I am convinced Zitu himself but uses you as his agent. These things never
  came from a mortal brain alone," the Prince, of Aphur replied.</p>

  <p>"Man comes by Zitu's will; why should not Zitu use man for the things it
  pleases him to do?" said Croft.</p>

  <p>"You do not deny it?" Robur spoke in almost startled fashion.</p>

  <p>"Nay. Have I not already said that all I did was by Zitu's grace?"</p>

  <p>There were times when Croft found it hard to avoid a direct avowal of the
  actual state which was his, times when he hungered to make some human soul a
  confidant concerning all that had occurred. And he loved the strong young man
  by his side.</p>

  <p>Now, however, Robur laughed in a somewhat unsteady way. "There are times
  when you cause me to stand in awe of your power, Jasor, my friend," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Think you not Zollaria will stand in awe of our weapons when they are in
  the hands of our men, on foot or mounted in the cars I have armored and
  pierced with holes for the barrels of the rifles?" Croft asked.</p>

  <p>"Aye, by Zitu!" Robur shouted. "Turn around Jasor&mdash;and 'let her out.'
  We must return to our work."</p>

  <p>But that night Croft drove out to the mountains, taking his rifle along.
  Others were being assembled now, and he had seen Jadgor himself and arranged
  for the beginning of the army they must raise. The thing would be started by
  a public demonstration, at which Croft should show the power of the new
  weapon. The men of Aphur, and Nodhur, and Milidhur would be invited to join.
  To each who did so a rifle would be given wholly as his property for all time
  to come, and a certain wage would be given also while they were being
  trained.</p>

  <p>Fired by the thought. Croft asked for a copy of the Tamarizian alphabet,
  found it not unlike the ancient Maya inscriptions in Central America and had
  taken it to the shop and set his pattern- makers to forming molds for the
  making of type. He intended printing proclamations of the coming call for
  volunteers and posting them about the streets, where those who knew how to
  read might understand and impart the knowledge to their fellows.</p>

  <p>Thus to his inventions he added the printing-press, crude, and for large
  work only at first, but printing none the less. He had taken all this up with
  Jadgor, and advised waiting another month, until many rifles were finished or
  being made, since the civic and royal guards would form the nucleus of the
  army and must be armed before a call for volunteers. Jadgor had listened to
  all he said, gazing at the dead water-fowl Robur had insisted on lugging into
  the palace. He examined the wound made by the bullet and agreed to all his
  son and Croft had asked. Now at the end of the day Croft was speeding forth
  to show the woman he loved the thing which should win for them their heart's
  desire, and wreck Zollaria's plans.</p>

  <p>Lakkon himself met him as he descended at the door. Despite his resolve
  Croft's visits were growing more and more frequent and Lakkon was not a
  fool.</p>

  <p>"My lord," he said, giving his hand, "what brings you again thus
  soon?"</p>

  <p>Croft drew himself up. "Success," he returned. "I came but to prove to you
  the power of the first of the new weapons we have made. And having done so I
  shall return to Himyra so soon as I may."</p>

  <p>"Nay." A trouble expression waked in Lakkon's eyes. "Take not my words
  amiss." He seemed suddenly abashed. "The weapon does all you said?"</p>

  <p>"Aye. I shall show you and the princess, if I may."</p>

  <p>Lakkon's eyes flashed. The meaning of this wonder-worker's statement, if
  proved, which he did not doubt, swept all else out of his mind for the
  time.</p>

  <p>"What do you require?" he asked in a tense tone.</p>

  <p>Croft glanced about. Below him near the lake in a mountain meadow were
  some of the strange sheep-like cattle, knee deep in grass. He gestured toward
  them with his hand. "Permission to slay one of those."</p>

  <p>"Granted, so be you can do it," Lakkon smiled. The distance was twice the
  range of any bow.</p>

  <p>Croft reflected the smile as he made answer. "If the princess may be
  summoned." He turned and took the rifle from the car.</p>

  <p>Lakkon eyed it with unconcealed interest. He called the Mazzerian from
  within the door and directed that Naia be bidden to appear.</p>

  <p>While they waited, Croft opened the magazine and extracted a bullet. He
  was explaining it to Lakkon when Naia hurried forth. "A powder within the
  shell furnishes the power to propel the ball in the end," he finished in time
  to greet her. "And now Prince Lakkon, to take you at your word." He lifted
  the shining barrel.</p>

  <p>"What would you do?" Naia exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Behold," said Croft and fired.</p>

  <p>Far below in the meadow one of the woolly creatures appeared to stumble,
  to stagger a pace or two forward before it sank into the grass.</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" came Lakkon's voice.</p>

  <p>Croft smiled.</p>

  <p>Naia approached. Her face was devoid of color&mdash;as white as though the
  bullet had pierced her heart instead of the body of the unknowing sacrifice
  to developing science, now lying in swift dissolution beside the lake. Slowly
  she put forth a finger and touched the shining thing in Croft's hands.</p>

  <p>"This is the new weapon?" she said in a sibilant whisper, and lifted her
  face to his.</p>

  <p>"Aye. And having shown Lakkon its power, I must return to Himyra." Croft
  turned toward the car. He hoped she would understand his abruptness, since
  after Lakkon's words he was afraid to meet the glance of her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Return?" she cried protestingly. "Must you go so soon, my lord?"</p>

  <p>"The need presses," Lakkon cut in. "Lord Jasor came but to show us the
  last fruits of his wonderful knowledge. I called you to witness the test. You
  need not remain."</p>

  <p>"You see," he went on as Naia turned with a quivering lip and slowly
  mounted the stairs.</p>

  <p>"What?" Croft met him eye to eye.</p>

  <p>"That my daughter is a woman, Jasor of Nodhur, and that your name is a
  word on every tongue in Aphur, and that the princess is pledged to
  Cathur."</p>

  <p>"Who will forswear his pledge," Croft interrupted, knowing Jadgor must
  have told the counselor what they had discussed.</p>

  <p>"If your words be true?"</p>

  <p>"You doubt them?"</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;yet Lakkon is a name of honor, and a pledge is a pledge until
  broken indeed."</p>

  <p>"And should it be so broken?" Croft leaned a trifle toward him from the
  hips.</p>

  <p>"Aphur would refuse you nothing," Prince Lakkon said.</p>

  <p>Croft laughed as he sprang into his seat. "Forget not those words. Prince
  Lakkon," he flung back as he started the car.</p>

  <p>He drove to Himyra in a rage. Before him floated a vision of Naia's purple
  eyes gone black with hurt misunderstanding, of her quivering crimson lips.
  But his rage was as much with himself as with Lakkon, to tell the truth. He
  had been indiscreet after promising discretion. He had gone to the mountains
  too often. He had let eye and voice speak too plainly those things in his
  soul. Lakkon had been blind not to see what was ripening under his nose. And
  Lakkon was a man of honor according to his code.</p>

  <p>He drove to the palace, found Gaya, and told her the whole thing from
  beginning to end.</p>

  <p>"You mean that the maiden loves you?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Aye," Croft said.</p>

  <p>"You have told her of your love?" Gaya seemed a bit breathless as she
  paused.</p>

  <p>"Aye." Croft inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"You are mad!"</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;I am in love. It comes to the same thing." Croft smiled.</p>

  <p>"Ga and Azil help you both," Gaya returned. "I can do nothing.
  And&mdash;you must not imperil her honor, my lord. But&mdash;I shall make it
  my task to see her and explain the manner of your return tonight, and," her
  color deepened swiftly, "to assure her of your love."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sweet Gaya." Croft rose. "You are a blessed
  hypocrite&mdash;and a true woman."</p>

  <p>He bent and gripped her hand. And Gaya smiled upon him because he was a
  strong man and she was a woman indeed.</p>

  <p>For the rest, as the days and weeks dragged away, Croft sought to drown
  himself in attention to his work. All day he toiled and oftentimes far into
  the night. Jasor's splendid physique stood him in good stead during the
  months of preparation.</p>

  <p>There were no labor troubles in Aphur. The state fixed the scale of wages,
  and those who would not work were summarily sent to the mines to dig the
  metals needed by their more energetic fellow citizens. Thus the fifth month
  passed.</p>

  <p>Rifles were being turned forth in a glittering array at Himyra and Ladhra
  and stored with their ammunition for the time of need. Croft finished his
  printing-press and struck from it the first bulletins which should appeal to
  the men of three states to come to their country's need.</p>

  <p>"Citizens of Tamarizia," Croft wrote. "Shall Tamarizia weaken or grow
  strong? Recall the heritage your forebears left. Yours is the Central Sea.
  Yours is a government of the people, for the people, under liberal heads of
  state, who express the people's will as set forth once in a cycle by the
  state assemblies you by your votes elect. But a government by the people is
  strong only as the people themselves shall make it. Citizens make Tamarizia
  strong as never before.</p>

  <p>"Let each man step to the fore and agree to serve as a soldier for one
  year. To each shall be given a weapon which he may keep. Ponder on this. If
  each year each man of good health and a certain age shall for one year win
  his weapon and learn concerning its use, how long before Tamarizia shall be
  so strong in the strength of her men that she shall be safe in the possession
  of the proud station those brave men your forefathers left to you in trust?
  Ask of your civic captains concerning this. Enroll yourself as citizens of
  Tamarizia under them."</p>

  <p>These bulletins were posted in Aphur, Nodhur and Milidhur, and in the
  capital of each state a public demonstration of the new army weapon was held
  by a picked squad of Jadgor's royal guards whom Croft had taught to shoot. At
  each a herd of taburs was slaughtered, singly and in groups. All southwest
  Tamarizia gasped. The word flew from mouth to mouth. The stories fired men's
  hearts. They flocked to the captains of the city guards.</p>

  <p>Croft began teaching the royal guard and the guard of Himyra, the school
  of the company and squad, marksmanship and a simple manual of arms. They
  learned quickly and inside a month he sent many of them as special
  instructors to all Aphur and the other southern states. Thus far things had
  progressed to the end of the ninth month, when the imperial throne at Zitra
  interfered. A messenger arrived, commanding Jadgor and all others responsible
  for the warlike activity in Aphur and Nodhur to appear before Tamhys with the
  least possible delay.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">XX. &mdash; WHEN THE EMPEROR HEDGED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE thing was not unexpected to Croft.</p>

  <p>From the start he had feared some such event. Hence, without offering
  explanation to Jadgor he had taken steps to convince Magur of Himyra of the
  death-like stupor in which his body lay at such times as he was absent from
  it. He had gone on one occasion to the pyramid and deliberately left Jasor's
  form sitting in a chair, while he projected himself to Scira and found out
  Abbu, now for some months engaged in keeping watch on the moves of Cathur's
  prince. Returning to find Magur standing above him in something like awe, he
  had told exactly what Abbu was doing at the time, and requested Magur to
  verify his words in any fashion he chose.</p>

  <p>Now faced by the imperial interference with all his plans, he called Magur
  to his aid. He took him to Zitra, with Jadgor, Lakkon and himself, making the
  journey quickly in a motor-driven craft and taking the messenger along.</p>

  <p>Croft marveled at Zitra, despite all he had seen of Tamarizian
  architecture before. It rose crystal and silver and white, save that the
  temple of Zitu, surmounting a pyramid twice the size of that at Himyra was of
  an azure-blue stone&mdash;the color of the highest priesthood, as he was to
  learn. The palace of Tamhys was a marvel to the eye&mdash;vaster than
  Himyra's mighty white structure, built wholly of white and crystal and roofed
  with burnished silver, paved with alternate squares of silver, and crystal,
  and gold.</p>

  <p>The thing was unbelievable, Croft felt. He moved as in a dream. This was
  the central city of empire, impregnable to any weapon then known on Palosian
  soil. Its walls rose sheer from the sea on the side which they approached.
  The harbor was within them. Sea-gates closed the entrance with leaves of
  copper, covered by silver faces. The walls themselves were white. Darting
  through the gates their galley entered the gulf of a harbor smooth as glass
  wherein were mirrored the quays and structures along the water's edge. The
  cool green of trees banked the terraces and relieved the well-nigh blinding
  radiance created by the sun upon the glistening white. He forgot everything
  in the beauty of the vision and exclaimed aloud.</p>

  <p>Magur watched him, well pleased. His pleasure grew as Croft turned and
  faced the monstrous pile of the pyramid and the pure blue temple on the top.
  They landed, and while the wharf-men were unloading a motor which Croft had
  brought as a present for Tamhys, and the messenger hurried to the palace to
  announce their arrival, he led Croft to one side.</p>

  <p>"I would have you meet Zud, High Priest of all Tamarizia," he said. "We
  who keep alive the love of Zitu in the hearts of the nation are not devoid of
  all material power, my friend."</p>

  <p>Croft inclined his head. He had hoped for something of this sort; had
  planned for it, indeed. "I also serve Zitu in my way," he declared. "I should
  be honored to enter the presence of him he has seen fit to exalt to so high a
  degree."</p>

  <p>An armed guard appeared, escorting a number of gnuppa-drawn chariots. At
  the invitation of a noble in glistening cuirass and helmet, the party from
  Himyra entered the cars and drove toward the palace through the streets paved
  in broad, flat stones. Croft, however, insisted on driving the motor he had
  brought, and with him went Magur, the priest.</p>

  <p>Tamhys would grant them audience that evening, it appeared.</p>

  <p>Magur smiled. He beckoned the noble to his side. "Then will Jasor of
  Nodhur, who sits before me, visit first on Zud," he announced. "Say this to
  Tamhys, when you reach the palace with Lakkon of Aphur and Jadgor, Aphur's
  king."</p>

  <p>The man saluted and withdrew without question. Once more Magur smiled.
  Croft started the engine and moved off in the wake of the gnuppas that he
  might not frighten them out of their wits.</p>

  <p>"Turn here," said Magur after a time. Inside ten minutes they stopped in
  front of the main approach to the mighty pyramid.</p>

  <p>Magur told of what he had seen and of what he had heard. The High Priest
  eyed him when he finished.</p>

  <p>"Magur believes these things?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Aye, as in Zitu I believe." Magur inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"That these things are of Zitu, through Jasor of Nodhur's mind?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, Zud, servant of Zitu, so I believe."</p>

  <p>Zud turned his eyes from the priest to Croft and back. "First came he to
  you, at Himyra, from Abbu the brother at Scira," he recited Magur's
  words.</p>

  <p>"Aye."</p>

  <p>"As a servant of Zitu's undreamed designs to come."</p>

  <p>"Zud speaks the words present in my mind."</p>

  <p>"Before the audience my request to be present shall reach Tamhys," Zud
  decided. "And now, Jasor of Nodhur, how come you by the knowledge of things
  undreamed?"</p>

  <p>Croft told him so much as he dared.</p>

  <p>"My body lies as dead. In truth my spirit leaves it. And, while absent,
  acquires the knowledge with which it returns."</p>

  <p>"As a voice?" said Zud.</p>

  <p>"Nay, as something shown to me, together with the manner in which it may
  be made."</p>

  <p>Zud rose and lifted his hands. "Who may understand Zitu?" he intoned in a
  voice of amazement. Croft felt he was convinced.</p>

  <p>Hence when he stood that night before the white-haired Tamhys, he felt a
  quiet assurance born of the belief that Magur and Zud, both present, were his
  friends, and they were the friends of his cause.</p>

  <p>"Jadgor of Aphur," Tamhys began. "I have now summoned you before me, since
  for some time I have had you beneath my eye. You have married your son to a
  princess of Milidhur, and within half a cycle you have betrothed your
  sister's child to Cathur, and Belzor of Nodhur and yourself are friends. Thus
  only Bithur seems not swayed in more or less degree by those wishes which are
  yours, and you wax strong in power. Why have you done these things?"</p>

  <p>"Tamhys of Tamarizia," Jadgor replied, "these things I do not deny. Robur
  of Aphur wedded the Princess Gaya for love. Nodhur's interests are one with
  Aphur, since both possess the Na within their lines. Naia has plighted her
  troth to Kyphallos of Aphur at my wish to make strong the guard of the
  western gate and assure to Tamarizia those things she holds." He spoke boldly
  and faced the emperor of his nation with an unflinching eye.</p>

  <p>But Tamhys frowned. "This is not all," he said. "It has come to my ear
  that you have in Himyra a man&mdash;Jasor of Nodhur&mdash;who stands now
  before me&mdash;a man who works new marvels undreamed of before&mdash;that
  some of them are weapons, designed for the work of war&mdash;that Aphur and
  Nodhur and Milidhur increase the men in their guards to an unwarranted
  degree. What say you to this?"</p>

  <p>"That you have heard the truth, O Tamhys," Jadgor again replied. "These
  things have been made. The guards have been increased. These things also have
  I done to make Tamarizia strong."</p>

  <p>The lines of Tamhys's countenance contracted further.' His features grew
  dark and he clenched a hand. "You are a man of power, Jadgor of Aphur," he
  cried. "Power is beneath your nostrils. Hence you dream of war. Yet is war
  not of my creed, nor shall be. For fifty cycles has Tamarizia known
  peace&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;and fifty cycles past lost she the State of Mazhur, because she
  knew not the art of war as she knows it now," Jadgor flared into
  interruption. Strong man that he was and crafty, he knew not the diplomatic
  speech. "Is she to lose Cathur now as well?" he rushed on and paused.</p>

  <p>Tamhys smiled as one might at a child. "Jadgor of Aphur, the warning I
  have received concerning your aims comes to me from the loyal house of Cathur
  itself. Cathur thinks your eyes turn toward the throne. To me that is of
  little consequence. Yet you hesitate to see one mount the throne of Zitra to
  plunge our nation in war. You think, perhaps, to win Mazhur back."</p>

  <p>"And if I should&mdash;should I make Tamarizia whole again!" Jadgor's
  voice rose with a fervid fire of patriotic feeling.</p>

  <p>As for Croft, he felt assured he understood, the situation better now.
  Cathur's spies had carried word of what was forward as he had felt assured
  they would. Cathur of Zollaria's prompting thus sought through the
  peace-loving Tamhys to tie the hands of Tamarizia while she made ready for
  the blow she expected to strike ere long. He said as much to Magur, who
  repeated it to Zud.</p>

  <p>Tamhys smiled again. "Should you attempt it, you would send our sons to
  death for a little ground. Let be, Jadgor. Hold we not the western gate as
  always? Are the wails of dying men and the sobs of women things grown sweet
  to your ears?"</p>

  <p>"Nay; but if Cathur falls&mdash;if Zollaria makes war and we cannot defend
  what yet remains of our ground?" Jadgor's voice shook as he saw the end of
  his dream of strength in view.</p>

  <p>"Would Zollaria have waited fifty years to make war had she it in mind?"
  Tamhys asked.</p>

  <p>"Then what does Tamhys wish?" Jadgor inquired, with a sigh. He was no
  traitor, and under the law he must heed the emperor's word.</p>

  <p>"That you cease those unwise undertakings&mdash;that you send the men from
  the shops of their making back to their fathers' trades; that you cease to
  dream of war and pursue the ways of peace in which we have prospered in the
  past. That you turn Jasor of Nodhur's mind to other things than the making of
  the instruments of destruction. I have heard he has builded chariots which
  run seemingly of themselves, and galleys which propel themselves up rivers
  and across the seas. Those things are well. Jadgor, I command that you
  forsake&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hold, Tamhys!" It was Zud, the High Priest, who spoke. "Truth you have
  been told, yet not all the truth as it appears. None know the plans of Zitu
  save Zitu himself. A priest, I am as yourself, a man of peace. Yet Zitu
  himself may send a war at times to, like a sorrow, purge the soul of the
  nation and recall it to him, even as a grief may turn the soul of a man to
  higher things. Jasor of Nodhur was a dullard till Zitu opened his mind. He
  died as his physician declares, yet now he lives again, and speaks with a
  mind inspired.</p>

  <p>"Himself he says these things are delivered unto him while his body lies
  as dead. This I have from Magur of Himyra who has seen him in such a sleep,
  and Magur has the account of his changing from Abbu of Scira who administered
  to him the last rites of life, ere he seemingly died. Hence Zitu's hand
  appears in this to the minds of Magur and myself. Shall Tamhys seek to
  interfere when Zitu directs?"</p>

  <p>For the first time the emperor wavered in his course. Man of peace and
  believer in the State religion, the priest's words had a powerful effect upon
  his mind.</p>

  <p>"If he comes as an agent of Zitu, why came he not first to Zitra?" he
  questioned at length.</p>

  <p>Zud smiled. "Zitu acts many times through the means at hand. It were
  easier to convince the mind of Jadgor perhaps than to persuade Tamhys," he
  replied.</p>

  <p>The emperor winced, and turned to Jadgor again. "Swear to me by Zitu that
  your acts were meant for Tamarizia's welfare and for no advancement of self
  through an increase of your power," he required.</p>

  <p>Jadgor's face set into lines of a swift resentment. His color mounted, but
  he, controlled his voice. "I swear it, O Tamhys," he said.</p>

  <p>"These weapons are for Tamarizia's defense alone?"</p>

  <p>"As Zitu sees my heart."</p>

  <p>Tamhys chose a middle course. "Keep, then, what you have," he decreed;
  "yet fashion not any more. Nor urge your men to look for war, when peace is
  in their land. I have heard of strange writings posted on walls, inviting men
  to join your guards."</p>

  <p>Jadgor's face was dark, but he bowed in submission to the emperor's
  command.</p>

  <p>"What of the men who stand pledged at present?" he asked. "I have promised
  them a stated wage for a cycle.. It is understood. My word has passed."</p>

  <p>"At the end of the cycle, let them be dismissed," said Tamhys after some
  thought.</p>

  <p>Again Jadgor bowed.</p>

  <p>Yet Croft found himself not unduly cast down, and he thought he caught a
  smile in Lakkon's eyes. Suspecting some such event as had just transpired, he
  had instructed Robur to speed the assembling of all rifles both at Himyra and
  at Landhra, before leaving for Zitra himself.</p>

  <p>Tamhys's decision regarding such weapons as already existed he determined
  to accept in its broadest sense of application, and as for the dismissal of
  the guards now in process of training at the end of a cycle, he knew full
  well that they would probably not be needed after that time, or so hotly
  engaged that even Tamhys would rescind his decree. Hence he felt that things
  had not turned out so badly as they might, and he fancied Lakkon's view of
  the matter was practically the same. In fact, his feeling was now as all
  along&mdash;a wonder that Tamhys had not interfered before as he had
  oftentimes feared he would. That he understood better now, having seen the
  man. He was old&mdash;wedded to a theory, rather than of practical type. His
  very begging of the issue as shown by his final ruling showed this. He
  carried his desire for peace even into this conference to which he had called
  the men before him, and reached&mdash;a useless compromise which while
  nominally affecting the end at which he aimed, yet literally made small
  difference to Croft's plans, and, as he suddenly saw, would, when reported to
  Cathur and by Cathur given to other ears, result in no more than a
  determination on Zollaria's part to carry out her intent. This since she
  would now in all likelihood believe she had tied Jadgor's hands by stopping
  the manufacture of the weapon Croft had devised.</p>

  <p>He said as much to Jadgor and Lakkon once they were alone, and for the
  first time Jadgor appeared pleased.</p>

  <p>"Nor," said Croft, "has Tamhys forbidden the construction of other
  weapons, my friends."</p>

  <p>"Hai!" Jadgor's tight lips relaxed. He gave Lakkon a glance. "By Zitu! So
  he did not. Jasor&mdash;you have other things in mind."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. It had occurred to him that, with powder and plenty of
  metal, it would not be impossible to construct some very effective forms of
  grenades. He explained, and Jadgor's eyes flashed fire.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">XXI. &mdash; MUCH MISCHIEF AFOOT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The morrow saw them on their return journey to Himyra, with
  Croft pushing his engine top speed. He wanted to get back and to work on the
  grenades at once, for two reasons. First, that they would offset in part at
  least the embargo against the manufacture of more rifles, and because it
  occurred to him that they would be of vast service should he have to force
  entrance to some enemy town. For now Croft was planning his campaign. His
  knowledge gained through his unsensed presence at the council at Niera months
  before made him believe that Zollaria would throw her entire weight on
  Cathur's northern frontier, while Mazzeria attacked Bithur and possibly
  eastern Milidhur.</p>

  <p>From a second motor-shop established at Ladhra and equipped with men
  trained in the Himyra plant he had already sent a motor-fleet to the capital
  of Gaya's home state for the rapid transport of troops to the frontier in
  case of need. He had organized a fleet of motor-driven marine transports to
  take men from Aphur and Nodhur to Bithur's aid.</p>

  <p>This expedition was to be led by Robur in person, and with him Croft had
  outlined each step so far as he could. They would proceed up that river
  promised Mazzeria for her aid in the war of conquest Zollaria planned, and
  debarking near the frontier, carry the war straight to the foe.</p>

  <p>As for himself, he planned with Jadgor to cross the Central Sea almost due
  north, capture Niera, and penetrate the State of Mazhur, thereby establishing
  a dangerous flank movement which, if successful, would result in withdrawing,
  the Zollarian army operating against Cathur's frontier. Two of his armored
  motors would go with the Milidhurian expedition and two with Robur against
  the blue men of Mazzer. The other sixteen would accompany the expedition
  north.</p>

  <p>These things he now explained to Jadgor, Lakkon and Magur while they
  rushed back to the capital of Aphur. They heard him and nodded agreement.</p>

  <p>Jadgor smiled and turned to the priest.</p>

  <p>"It appears Zitu has sent us a general as well as a genius of design," he
  exclaimed. "If Zitu inspires not his mind directly, then is he the most
  wonderful man Tamarizia has seen."</p>

  <p>"Raised up for Tamarizia's hour of great need, O Jadgor," Magur
  declared.</p>

  <p>"And who should raise him save Zitu, who knows the future as we know the
  present and past? Zud says as much, and I believe it. Praised be Zitu's
  name." He made the odd horizontal sign of the cross Croft had first seen Abbu
  of Scira use.</p>

  <p>"Nay, I doubt it not," Jadgor replied. "Tamhys shall yet live to learn the
  truth of this!"</p>

  <p>Yet Croft, despite the religious superstitions of these truly patriotic
  minds, was human after all. He plunged into a frenzy of work on his return.
  He explained all to Robur, saw him thoroughly versed in the making of the
  grenades, leaped into his car and drove to Ladhra to begin operations
  there.</p>

  <p>Two weeks elapsed while he was getting everything to his satisfaction, and
  during those two weeks other things happened, which he could not foresee.</p>

  <p>He returned to Himyra late one afternoon, drove to the shops, saw
  everything running smoothly, listened to the reports of Robur, who was
  enthusiastic over the progress being made, and drove on to the palace to
  bathe and rest for an hour, since even the splendid physique of Jasor's body
  was beginning to feel the strain of the months of scheming and toiling.</p>

  <p>Fresh from his bath, he was suddenly minded to seek Gaya and learn if
  there were any word from Naia, such as she frequently sent him by Robur's
  wife. He found her awaiting Robur's return, and proffered his request.</p>

  <p>That Gaya was glad to see him there could be no doubt. His coming seemed
  to afford her relief.</p>

  <p>"My lord, your coming lightens my heart," she declared after Croft had
  greeted her by sinking on one knee. "The maid sent you her farewell, and
  asked that I say this much more: 'Tell him to forget not his promise.' She
  did not explain, yet I have felt you would know the meaning of her
  words."</p>

  <p>"Her farewell? You say she sent me that?" exclaimed Croft, staring into
  her face. "By Zitu, Gaya, my friend, what meant she by that?"</p>

  <p>"You know not of her absence from Aphur?" Gaya widened her eyes in
  surprise. "You have not heard?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard nothing. I came to you for word," Croft began, and paused
  with an odd grip taking hold of his heart.</p>

  <p>"Aye," Gaya wrinkled her brows. "Some days ago an escort came from Cathur,
  asking that the maid and Lakkon, her father, visit Scira, in order that
  Kyphallos might present his bride-to-be to his people before he ascended the
  throne."</p>

  <p>"Kyphallos on the throne of Cathur!" Croft frowned. "Has Scythys, then,
  laid down the scepter in favor of his son?"</p>

  <p>"Scythys has died," Gaya said. "Wherefore, despite the fact that the cycle
  of betrothal has not run out, Kyphallos craves the privilege of entertaining
  Naia and her father, and assuring his people that he has chosen a worthy
  queen as his consort on the throne."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;and she&mdash;and they&mdash;have gone?" Croft stammered as he
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Aye." Gaya looked into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Jasor, what of it? I&mdash;I am a woman, and I have thoughts&mdash;fears,
  perhaps, or fancies. I like this journey not. What does it portend?"</p>

  <p>"That I know not; yet shall I ascertain," Croft replied between set teeth.
  "She told me to forget not my promise. By Zitu and Azil and Ga, I shall not.
  Gaya, my sweet woman, how long have they been gone?"</p>

  <p>"This is the third day since they departed, my lord."</p>

  <p>"They went&mdash;how?"</p>

  <p>"In the ship which brought the escort&mdash;one Kyphallos sent."</p>

  <p>"The day after tomorrow they arrive. So then there is time."</p>

  <p>Croft relaxed somewhat the physical tension which had held him, and his
  voice grew less sharp. He sighed.</p>

  <p>"Time? Time for what, Jasor?" Gaya inquired.</p>

  <p>"Tonight I shall sleep," Croft told her frankly. "And while I sleep I
  shall learn what is the true intent of this sudden desire on Kyphallos's part
  to show Cathur their queen."</p>

  <p>Gaya's eyes grew wide. "You shall sleep&mdash;as you sleep to learn?" she
  faltered.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Croft smiled. "And I shall learn, wife of my friend. Zitu made Naia
  of Aphur a maid to madden men's blood, not for Cathur, but for Jasor. Yes, I
  shall learn."</p>

  <p>But despite his confident tone he was more than a little disturbed as he
  sought his own rooms that night and stretched himself on his couch. What
  intent lurked in the mind of Cathur's prince he could not see. Nor could he
  understand why, knowing what already he had told them, Jadgor and Lakkon had
  decided to accede to the Cathurian's request, unless they had followed the
  other man's course at the time of the betrothal and acted in order to blind
  suspicion of their counter-preparations so far as they might, or at least to
  avoid an open rupture at this time.</p>

  <p>Hence it appeared doubly important that he should learn what was toward in
  Cathur now. He focused his mind. His body relaxed. He projected his
  intelligent ego toward Scira to discover what it might.</p>

  <p>At first he went to the cell of Abbu in the Scira pyramid to learn, if he
  might, what Abbu was about.</p>

  <p>He found him speaking with a brother priest&mdash;was half-minded to
  leave&mdash;yet lingered, held by the first remark of the unknown monk.</p>

  <p>"A nice time for Kyphallos to be at Niera, with his promised queen
  approaching Scira on the sea."</p>

  <p>"He will return in time to greet her," Abbu said.</p>

  <p>"Yet I like not his frequent journeyings to Niera, nor his association
  with the Zollarian nobles who make it their resort. Nor does Cathur like it
  overly well."</p>

  <p>Abbu frowned. "Nor does Cathur like the stories which come back from
  Anthra concerning the things which occur there in the palace. Adita, they
  tell me, is more worshiped than Zitu. Ga, the true woman, or Azil, her son,
  have small consideration. 'Tis Adita, woman of folly and beauty, whose shrine
  is there."</p>

  <p>"I have heard said that, while a creature of beauty, this Aphurian
  princess is not given to folly," his lay brother replied. "Mayhap she shall
  win Kyphallos from his present course, and so prove a blessing to Cathur in
  cycles to come."</p>

  <p>"If so be she mounts the throne at all."</p>

  <p>"You think she will not?"</p>

  <p>Abbu shrugged. "Who knows? Cathur mutters even now, as you know. Scythys
  was a dotard. Kyphallos is a degenerate. Cathur is the worst-governed state
  in all Tamarizia&mdash;the most beset with taxes, with the least returns to
  show. But&mdash;Cathur is loyal to Tamarizia as a people. Think you they will
  long brook a king who makes merry with Zollarian nobles, while affairs of
  state go to pot?"</p>

  <p>"Come!" cried the other. "You have heard something, Abbu, it would
  seem."</p>

  <p>Abbu nodded. "Perhaps I keep my eyes and ears about me when I leave the
  pyramid."</p>

  <p>Croft left. At least, he thought, Abbu was attending to his duties as
  Aphur's spy in so far as he might. And Cathur was muttering against their
  soon-to-be king. Cathur, then, was loyal&mdash;what if Kyphallos found her
  betrayal less easy than he expected? He smiled and willed himself to Niera,
  since now it appeared the Cathurian profligate was once more there. And if
  there, Croft thought he knew where to find him. He would be, almost without
  doubt, in the presence of Kalamita of the tawny eyes and hair. And it was
  with her and her brother and Bzad, the Mazzerian chief, he found him, in a
  room of that palace overlooking the Central Sea. They sat together in a
  low-toned conversation. Evidently something important was forward, since they
  had closeted themselves thus, thought Croft.</p>

  <p>Kalamita stretched her supple length like a cat about to yawn, and turned
  a slow smile on the Cathurian prince.</p>

  <p>"So then," she said, "it is all thought out. You men, with your spears and
  swords, are far stronger than subtle, my lords. Leave the subtlety to a woman
  in your plans."</p>

  <p>"I see no chance of failure in this, I confess," Bzad spoke as she paused.
  Croft noted a flash in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Not unless you bungle." Kalamita laughed.</p>

  <p>"I?" Bzad growled. "By Adita, goddess of beautiful women, I shall make no
  mistake. See, I shall repeat it step by step. On the fourth day after the
  princess arrives, Kyphallos of Cathur invites her and her father to visit
  Anthra, and they take the ship the next day. Meanwhile I place my galley
  under the cover of Anthra and wait. At the same hour they set sail I slip
  forth. Midway we meet and I sail close in passing. A collision seeming
  imminent, in the confusion a wrong order is given on board Kyphallos's
  galley. The prow of my galley strikes his ship as it seeks to cross my bows
  through turning in the wrong direction. Kyphallos and the maid are saved.
  Lakkon drowns, and any surviving sailors on board the Cathurian ship are
  destroyed, so that none shall survive to tell what happened really.</p>

  <p>"I sail to Scira and put Kyphallos ashore. We tell a story of disaster in
  which all perished save only him. According to it, this Naia died with her
  father. I sail away. She is mine&mdash;and once in Mazzeria, think you I
  shall not enjoy her beauty By Adita, I think I shall!"</p>

  <p>Kalamita nodded. "You have it, Bzad," she, declared, "and soon you shall
  have her&mdash;to do with as you please. They tell me she is very fair
  indeed. She should bring you joy for some time."</p>

  <p>A blind rage&mdash;a fiery disgust and loathing filled Croft's soul as he
  heard the wanton's words. This was the fate her soiled brain had evolved for
  the pure, sweet jewel of womanhood for whom his spirit cried. Yet since in
  his present state there was no chance for expression of those things he felt,
  he controlled his horror at the thought of Naia as the plaything of this
  cold-faced blue savage, and learned all he could.</p>

  <p>"Thereafter," Bandhor spoke for the first time, with a thin- lipped leer,
  "our good lord Kyphallos shall come to Anthra, after a period of mourning,
  and invite our sister to visit him for a time. But upon her desiring to leave
  he shall refuse. A man of her ship's crew shall escape Anthra in a boat and
  bring tidings, whereupon him to whom she is pledged shall lay the affair
  before the emperor himself. Our army shall be ready. An expedition shall
  proceed to Anthra to rescue Kalamita. In the meantime Kyphallos shall have
  taken her to Cathur, and have concealed her&mdash;placing her in the
  sanctuary of Ga, where the vestals will have her in charge. Then shall
  Zollaria attack, and Mazzer. Tamarizia, finding herself assailed on all
  sides, shall break like the crushed-in shell of an egg!" He contracted the
  fingers of a mighty hand until they were flexed in his palm. "Thus it shall
  be."</p>

  <p>Thus it shall be. Would it? Man proposes but God disposes, Croft thought
  to himself. Naia of Aphur the toy to a man of blue&mdash;a member of the
  servants' caste nation&mdash;Cathur to Zollaria. Tamarizia crushed. Kyphallos
  and his light o' love on the throne of Zitra where now the pacific old Tamhys
  sat. A pretty plan. Bzad and Bandhor, Kyphallos and Kalamita, in her scented
  and voluptuous beauty, seemed very sure it was coming about in time. To
  Croft, as he left them at their scheming and flitted back to his room in
  Aphur's palace, it seemed somewhat less likely to occur.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">XXII. &mdash; IN THE HABIT OF ZITU</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ONCE in the flesh again, conscious of all he had seen and
  heard, he sprang from his couch and dressed. He was going in the flesh to
  Scira. That one thing was clear in his mind. He would go to the capital of
  Cathur as quickly as his swiftest motor-galley might take him, and get into
  touch with Abbu and through him with Naia. After that, things must be met as
  they arose, only there was another thing on which he was equally determined:
  the girl should never embark for Anthra on the Prince of Cathur's craft.</p>

  <p>Leaving the palace, he entered his car, kept in the court now always for
  any emergency, and drove straight to the dock on the Na, where the fleet of
  motor-craft were kept busy. Here he selected a galley&mdash;one of the latest
  models he had prepared, sent runners to rout out the crew and order them
  aboard, ready to sail at once.</p>

  <p>From the dock he drove to the shops, flaring with light as the night-shift
  worked, called one of his most expert motor builders to one side, and
  directed him to report aboard the galley as quickly as he might. To him he
  gave authority to open a warehouse and provision the boat for a voyage of
  some days, and instructions to bring it to the quay below the palace so soon
  as ready to sail.</p>

  <p>Then he went back to the palace itself, and sent a nodding guard to rouse
  Robur and ask him to come to Croft's rooms. He waited there in a vast
  impatience until the door opened to admit Aphur's crown prince.</p>

  <p>That Robur was keyed to some expectancy he saw at a glance. The man's eyes
  were wide, his whole expression eager. Croft suspected Gaya had whispered
  wifely confidences into his ear earlier that night. He plunged into his theme
  at once:</p>

  <p>"Rob&mdash;I've slept&mdash;one of my certain sleeps. Gaya told you, I
  suppose."</p>

  <p>Robur nodded. "Yes. And you have learned, Jasor&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>Croft told him, and Robur swore a strong Aphurian oath. "They plan that,
  do they? Naia to Bzad, a man of Mazzer. By Zitu, Jasor, I am with you in
  whatever you mean to do."</p>

  <p>Croft shook his head. "Nay, Rob, my friend. Your duty is to Tamarizia
  first. You know all we have planned. Your place is here&mdash;to general the
  Bithurian expedition when it is time. Mine is the duty to the maid."</p>

  <p>"You love her." Robur made the statement direct.</p>

  <p>"Aye." Croft met it and looked him in the eye.</p>

  <p>Robur put forth a hand. "Azil be kind to you and her," he made answer.
  "What have you planned?"</p>

  <p>Croft explained his intent in a very few words. "I await now the lights of
  the galley at the quay below," he finished. "I desire to slip forth unknown
  to any save the guards. Will you drive me down with what arms I shall
  take?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," said. Aphur's heir. "You can reach Scira how soon?"</p>

  <p>"In two days&mdash;the day after Naia and Lakkon arrive."</p>

  <p>Robur smiled thinly. "Should you save Lakkon's life as well as his
  daughter's a second time, his gratitude should overcome much."</p>

  <p>Croft shook his head. "I plan not on gratitude, Rob. I myself shall
  overcome much&mdash;Kyphallos, Zollaria, and Mazzer. So shall I reach to the
  woman Zitu formed for me. I shall enter Scira at night, and go to the
  pyramid, and&mdash;Hold! Drive now with me to Magur. He must lend me a
  priestly robe."</p>

  <p>"Come!" Robur's eyes flashed. Once more he smiled. "A priest shall reach
  Scira, my friend? He shall go to the pyramid. I understand."</p>

  <p>The two men left the palace, entered the car, and crossed the bridge,
  swung into position on Robur's order. They stopped before the pyramid and
  hammered on the door. A sleepy priest admitted them at last-and sent them up
  on the primitive lift to Magur's lofty apartments. Magur himself appeared in
  the end, blinking sleepily with startled eyes when he faced Croft and Robur
  himself.</p>

  <p>Croft explained.</p>

  <p>Magur balked. "Shall the garments of Zitu be used for deception?" he
  exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Shall, not the garments of Zitu serve to guard a clean shrine of life
  from pollution?" Croft snapped in return. "Can the cloth of the Source of all
  Life be put to a better end?"</p>

  <p>Magur gave him a glance little short of admiration. "Ye speak, as always,
  with the words of Zitu himself," he returned. "I am convinced. Wait, and this
  matter shall be arranged." He turned away.</p>

  <p>In five minutes he was back with a dark-brown robe and hood, not unlike a
  cowl, also a pair of leather sandals and a cord with which to belt the robe
  about the waist. These he placed in Croft's hands, and raised his own. "Zitu
  go with ye, my son," he spoke in a formal blessing. "Should he favor ye on
  this mission, what shall ye do with the maid? Her return to Himyra would
  cause a clacking of tongues."</p>

  <p>"I have thought of that, O Magur," Croft replied. "The maid shall go to
  Zitra so quickly as she may. There Zud himself shall see her in sanctuary in
  the quarters of the virgins, until this thing has passed, unless you have
  better to suggest. Thus it is Zollaria plans to hide their unclean Kalamita
  in Scira. I am minded to turn their own trick upon themselves."</p>

  <p>"Nay," Magur smiled. "Thy plan is worthy of one of your mind. Go, then,
  and may Ga, the pure mother, use you to guard the maid."</p>

  <p>The galley lights glared red in the night at the quay as Croft and Robur
  drove back across the bridge, which opened behind them span by span. All was
  ready now save the arms and ammunition. Working in haste at the palace, the
  prince and Croft collected those and took them down to the ship.</p>

  <p>"You shall win, my friend," said Robur as he clasped hands with Croft at
  parting.</p>

  <p>Croft smiled somewhat grimly. "I shall win, Rob," he returned, "or you
  need not look for me back."</p>

  <p>Then he was off, dropping down the Na, passing the high-reared barrier of
  the walls, and once past those, opening the motor and speeding down the
  mighty yellow flood to the sea.</p>

  <p>A day passed, two days, and night came down. Far to the front the lights
  of Scira lifted above the waters. Croft called his crew and gave them their
  instructions in detail. They were to stay by the ship, were to be ready to
  start at once. Then, to their amaze, he slipped on the priest's robe over his
  cuirass and sword, and appeared before them thus as they approached the
  harbor gates. The standard of Aphur broke out at the galley's stern. They
  passed inside unchallenged and moored at the quay.</p>

  <p>To the harbor master&mdash;a huge Cathurian captain&mdash;Croft said
  merely that he was a priest come on a mission from Magur to the pyramid, and
  stepped ashore.</p>

  <p>And knowing Scira as he did, he set off in the right direction without
  delay, arrived in due time and without incident at the pyramid portals, and
  rapped for admission, asking for Abbu as soon as he was inside. Then&mdash;he
  was in Abbu's cell, fumbling with his robe and casting it from him, to stand
  in gold and silver harness before the monk's staring eyes.</p>

  <p>"My lord&mdash;my lord!" faltered the priest.</p>

  <p>"Hold." Croft lifted his hand. "Strange things are forward in Scira. What
  know you of them, Abbu, who have acted as Aphur's eyes?"</p>

  <p>"Yesterday the prince returned from Niera to greet the Aphurian maid he is
  to wed," Abbu replied. "It was a holiday occasion. The streets swarmed with
  people."</p>

  <p>"Think you Kyphallos intends to lead Naia to the throne?" Croft
  snapped.</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" Abbu lifted his hands in the sign of the cross. "Is it not so
  pledged, Jasor?"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;by the lips, yet not by the heart," said Croft. Swiftly he told
  the staring monk those things he had learned.</p>

  <p>"Zitu would not permit this," Abbu mumbled at the last.</p>

  <p>"Nay. Hence am I here. Listen, Abbu the priest. What I do, I do by the
  grace of Zitu&mdash;and with His consent. I am come to overthrow this most
  foul plot. You who have sworn to help me in Zitu's name must gain access to
  this maid. Say to her what is to be. Say to her thus when you have told her
  all else as a sign: 'Jasor has not forgotten.' Hearing this, she will
  believe. Say to her then that on the night after you have spoken to her she
  shall desire to speak with a priest from the holy pyramid, to receive a
  blessing before she is presented to Cathur's people. She shall prefer her
  request of Kyphallos himself, and insist that it be granted.</p>

  <p>"She shall specify the priest Abbu, whom she knows. I shall then go to her
  in the palace. Instruct her that her father shall be with her when I arrive.
  Thereafter shall we contrive a way out of the palace and to the boat I hold
  waiting for her escape. Say not to her that I shall come in your place. That
  she will learn when I appear. Now give me a place to sleep, and when you see
  her state these facts concerning Kyphallos's plan as things of your own
  knowledge, confessing to her that you have acted as Aphur's eyes for well
  nigh a whole cycle past."</p>

  <p>Abbu bowed. "Indeed," he said, "I believe you speak truth, O Jasor, and
  with Zitu's help I shall do all you say. Take my pallet for your slumber. I
  shall pray through the night for your success to Zitu himself."</p>

  <p>Throughout the next day Croft lay hid. Abbu brought him food in the
  morning and disappeared. He was not disturbed during the day. What Abbu was
  about he could not know. Only late in the day when the monk returned was he
  to learn how he had managed his task.</p>

  <p>"My lord, there was a pageant in honor of her of Aphur and her father," he
  explained. "The civic guard and that of the palace marched before them, while
  the people watched, and you know that it is a custom for the lay brothers of
  the pyramid to solicit alms. So with my little earthen jar I passed among the
  people, and after a time I approached the raised station where Aphur's
  princess sat, and lifting my little jar I cried to her as Cathur's
  queen-to-be that she give freely to Cathur's temple. This I did for a purpose
  which fell out as I desired. A guard about the noble party angrily bade me be
  off.</p>

  <p>"I lifted my voice in protest, crying again to that beautiful woman for
  alms.</p>

  <p>"She heard me, my lord. She has a gentle heart. 'Hold,' said she to the
  guard. 'Let the priest approach.' Thus, my lord, I gained her side, and she
  gave me pieces of silver enough to fill my jar, compelling all her party to
  contribute freely.</p>

  <p>"And when that had been done she asked me of our temple, and I told her
  concerning it, and called a blessing upon her, and contrived to whisper that
  I had an important message, meant for her ears alone.</p>

  <p>"The maid, my lord, is quick of comprehension. She turned to the prince
  himself. 'This priest finds favor with me,' she said. 'I would speak with him
  further. It may be that I shall select him for my own spiritual instructor
  once I am Cathur's queen.'</p>

  <p>"Kyphallos smiled, my lord. 'As you will, my princess,' he replied, and I
  think he suspected nothing.</p>

  <p>"Then the maid turned back to me and set a time for me to come to her at
  the palace on the morrow in the morning. Is it well, my lord?"</p>

  <p>"It is well," said Croft, though the delay of another day did not please
  his impatience to know Naia safe. "Yet there is more for you to do. Provide
  me a second robe such as Magur gave me which I wore here, and arrange for a
  carriage to be waiting tomorrow night on the street from the palace to the
  harbor. Do this in time that I may know the driver's name, when I shall come
  upon him, and so calling him identify myself as the man for whom he is
  employed. Here&mdash;" He drew a pouch and placed silver in Abbu's hand. "Pay
  the man well, and tell him to look for as much beyond what you give him if he
  serves me without fail. Also provide me a standard of Cathur's colors, such,
  as are used on ships."</p>

  <p>The latter request was due to a sudden thought which had popped into
  Croft's mind, and evoked a tight-lipped smile. He had conceived a way to
  throw consternation into the camp of his foes. He set about planning it out
  that same night and the succeeding day.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">XXIII. &mdash; WHEN THE TABLES WERE TURNED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AND when night came down once more on Scira he was ready.
  Once he had ventured forth, gone to the harbor, in seeming a priest, and
  conferred with the captain of his ship, telling him to be prepared to sail on
  the word that night.</p>

  <p>Back in the pyramid he waited Abbu's coming with what patience he could.
  The monk came about noon.</p>

  <p>"All things are ready, my lord, so far as time permits," he made his
  report.</p>

  <p>"You saw the maid?"</p>

  <p>"Aye."</p>

  <p>"And what said she?"</p>

  <p>"At first she was amazed, bewildered, I think, as was her father whom she
  summoned after I had told my tale, that I might relate it again to his ears.
  That was after I said to her the words you told me to repeat. Hearing them,
  she believed and called Prince Lakkon at once. His anger was great. He was
  for carrying the thing to Kyphallos himself and compelling him to admit or
  deny. But&mdash;both the maid and I prevailed upon him to see that by so
  doing he would destroy not only himself but her. In the end they agreed to
  summon me to the palace as soon as it fell dark."</p>

  <p>"That is well," said Croft. "The rest is prepared?"</p>

  <p>"The driver and the standard, aye. I shall give you the robe before you
  depart."</p>

  <p>"You shall live to receive your reward," said Croft; "Now we have naught
  to do save wait."</p>

  <p>And waiting proved the hardest part as the day dragged past. Of the
  adventure of the evening he had no fear. In fact he chafed to be at it as a
  restive horse frets at restraint. Never had the hours of a single day seemed
  so long in their course. He marked mid-afternoon, and watched the lowering
  sun. He welcomed evening and the creeping twilight. Dusk was a boon to give
  thanks for, and yet he raged because dusk having fallen, Naia did not send
  for Abbu the monk.</p>

  <p>Yet in the end Abbu appeared before him and whispered that the time was
  come&mdash;that a chariot from the palace waited without the pyramid. He
  carried a tightly rolled package in his hands and gave it to Croft. "The
  robe, my lord," he declared. "Zitu aid you in its use."</p>

  <p>"Zitu reward you, as I shall see you rewarded in a time to come," Croft
  told him, donning his own robe and thrusting the other beneath it.</p>

  <p>"Farewell for the present, Abbu. Your service is done."</p>

  <p>Leaving the pyramid he entered the chariot sent to fetch him and rode
  swiftly to the palace. Once as he noted his driver he smiled as he imagined
  the man's consternation could he dream who his passenger was despite his
  priestly seeming and the final results of this drive. But he spoke no word
  while they threaded the streets or when, the chariot pausing, he descended,
  passed inside the palace, and was led by a page to the Princess Naia's
  door.</p>

  <p>That door he entered, and for the first time in months found himself in
  the presence of the woman he loved.</p>

  <p>She rose and stood before him. "I have done as I promised my father, what
  more must I do?" he heard her sweet-toned voice.</p>

  <p>"Aye, what more have you to tell, us, Abbu, you could not tell us before?"
  asked Lakkon, rising from a couch placed farther back from the door.</p>

  <p>Croft threw off his enveloping cowl and robe. He stood before them, his
  cuirass with the sun of Aphur shining on its metal breast, sending a sparkle
  of light through the room. "Not Abbu this time, Prince Lakkon," he said.</p>

  <p>"Jasor!" Naia's eyes went wide. She started back a pace while her color
  faded swiftly, and she lifted her hand to her breast.</p>

  <p>"Jasor of Nodhur, by Zitu!" Lakkon cried. "Come, my lord, what means this
  priestly disguise?"</p>

  <p>"Life&mdash;for yourself&mdash;life and honor for your daughter, as I
  hope, since I know she would not live without the latter," Croft returned.
  "Hark you, Lakkon of Aphur. You are a man with a sword at your belt. Tell me
  is your daughter's serving-maid, Maia, of your party here?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," Lakkon returned, visibly impressed by Croft's presence and
  bearing.</p>

  <p>"Yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Enough," Croft cut him short. "Here is an extra robe of a priest. Let the
  princess and Maia don them and pass out of the palace doors. You and I shall
  walk forth together. To any who seek to stay us, I am your friend. I wear
  Aphur's arms. Let them stop two nobles of Aphur at their peril. Without the
  palace, the princess and the maid will turn to the right and walk down the
  street toward the harbor which is by happy chance toward the Scira pyramid.
  We shall overtake them. We shall enter a carriage and drive to the harbor and
  leave this nest of treason. Abbu has told before this what is planned."</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;but&mdash;" Lakkon stammered.</p>

  <p>"I shall prove his words true," Croft flashed. "Summon Maia quickly lest
  something intervenes."</p>

  <p>"Father&mdash;do as my lord advises." Naia laid a hand on Lakkon's
  arm.</p>

  <p>"By Zitu&mdash;I like it not, yet&mdash;if it be for your safety. Were it
  not&mdash;were it for myself alone&mdash;summon your maid." Jadgor's
  counselor yielded to her plea.</p>

  <p>The thing was so simple, indeed, that it made Croft smile. Inside five
  minutes the two women were prepared. Naia's wealth of hair was lost beneath
  the cowl. Croft opened the door and they sallied forth.</p>

  <p>"Be of good heart," he found means to whisper into Naia's ear. "You see I
  did not forget, O maid of gold."</p>

  <p>His reward was a quiet smile and a deep glance out of her eyes. Then she
  was gone, a monk seeming, with Maia at her side. Croft felt sure of their
  escape. Priests were no unusual sight about the palaces of the Tamarizian
  states. He doubted they would be questioned, even though two went out where
  one had come in.</p>

  <p>Hence he waited with the frowning Lakkon until some five minutes had
  passed. Then opening the door he strode forth and turned down toward the
  palace doors. Beside him Lakkon stalked in silence. "Talk to me&mdash;seem to
  converse for the sake of your daughter at least," Croft urged.</p>

  <p>Lakkon complied. In seemingly friendly converse they progressed. They
  reached the portals giving on the entrance court and passed the guards the
  more easily, perhaps, since none there as yet suspected what Kyphallos really
  planned, and so were not on guard against any act of the father of Cathur's
  queen-to-be, or some Aphurian friend of his, who wore the sun of Aphur in
  silver shining on his breast.</p>

  <p>Thus what might have proved difficult, proved easy. They left the court,
  overtook the women, led them to the carriage and drove swiftly to Croft's
  ship. There he paid and dismissed the driver and took his passengers aboard.
  Only when his sailors cast off the moorings did comment arise at his acts.
  Then a harbor guard appeared and questioned the proceeding. And by then Croft
  was once more a priest, while Maia had resumed her natural part. And the
  priest explained he must return to Himyra quickly.</p>

  <p>The guard saluted and withdrew with the monk's commendation of his
  attention to duty. The ship left the quay. It passed the harbor gates and
  floated free.</p>

  <p>Croft heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"On the fifth day you and your daughter would have journeyed to Anthra,"
  he turned to Lakkon to say. "Midway you would have been met by Bzad of Mazzer
  and your vessel rammed. Death for yourself and dishonor for your child would
  have swiftly followed. Lakkon of Aphur, I told you I would prove my words
  true, and I will. We shall meet this galley of the Mazzerian's midway to
  Anthra on the fifth day."</p>

  <p>Lakkon beat the planks of the deck with his foot. "Jasor of Nodhur, you
  are a bold man," he said. "You seem to have faith in your words. Yet should
  you fail to prove them, I think I shall have your head."</p>

  <p>"Then take mine with it, father," Naia, who had approached unseen by
  either man, burst forth. "Once before has Jasor saved our lives. Now saves he
  our lives and that which I prize higher still. You are hard to persuade, if
  you call him not son in the end."</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;fall it so!" Lakkon turned upon her. "To your quarters, girl. Is
  it seemly for her who values honor so highly, to offer herself to a man?"</p>

  <p>"To the one man, yes," she retorted, turning to go below. "Between him and
  her is no question of honor, nor of aught, save love. To that man she
  belongs, nor will yield to any other while Zitu gives her breath."</p>

  <p>"Azil, Giver of Life, and Ga, the Virgin!" Lakkon swore.</p>

  <p>"Peace!" Croft's hand fell on his arm. His heart was singing in his breast
  at Naia's words. "Hold, Lakkon! Let me prove my words true."</p>

  <p>And now Croft carried out the change he had made in his plans. All the
  succeeding day he sailed in circles, drawing nearer and nearer to Anthra
  rather than to Zitra. He lay to at night, keeping no more than headway on the
  ship.</p>

  <p>Just what Kyphallos might think when he found his affianced princess flown
  he did not know, but he smiled more than once as he fancied a pretty to-do in
  Scira, and a somewhat confused rage in the young reprobate's mind. For
  indeed, as he saw it, Kyphallos must sense himself in a rather precarious
  plight. His hostage to Bzad was gone. As yet there was no war. He might
  hardly send word to Aphur, that their princess and Lakkon were gone he knew
  not where. He must find it an embarrassing thing to explain the incident to
  Zollaria as well&mdash;a hard thing to make them swallow. A thing which might
  very well shake their confidence in himself.</p>

  <p>Indeed, as Croft saw it, Kyphallos would put off the explanation so long
  as he might, hoping to find some trace of the Aphurians themselves and
  thereby obviate any necessity of explaining anything at all. Yes, Croft
  chuckled to himself, Kyphallos was in something of a fix. Probably, though,
  failing to find his escaped guests the first day, he would go in person to
  meet Bzad. That must be foreseen. Hence it were best for Croft to be ready
  with his arms. He got them out and saw them loaded&mdash;and since he had
  chosen a war galley for his trip north, he had men aboard he had already
  trained in their use. He distributed the weapons to a selected number and was
  ready for what might occur.</p>

  <p>Lakkon saw the rifles in the hands of the men and questioned concerning it
  at once. Croft, nothing loath, explained the entire situation as he viewed
  it. "You have asked proof, and proof I intend to give you. Prince Lakkon," he
  declared. Lakkon's face grew grave. "Indeed, I think you believe all you say,
  my lord," he replied.</p>

  <p>"What do you intend?"</p>

  <p>"To meet Bzad close to Aphur," Croft explained. "To hang forth the
  standard of Cathur. To lure him close, and give you proof of what I have said
  from the man's own mouth."</p>

  <p>For so he had planned and was bent on carrying out. The morning of the
  fifth day found him therefore close to Anthra&mdash;yet not too close.</p>

  <p>Before its shores were more than a faint blur on the horizon the lookout
  reported a galley heading west.</p>

  <p>Croft called Lakkon and bade him stand beside him on the deck. He directed
  the standard of Cathur hung from the stern and ordered the speed of the
  engines increased. The galley surged toward the meeting at top speed. And the
  other galley came on.</p>

  <p>"She will sail very close," said Croft.</p>

  <p>Lakkon frowned.</p>

  <p>"At the last I am supposed to give a wrong order," Croft spoke again. "My
  helmsman knows his duty. We shall crush her near bank of oars."</p>

  <p>The two ships drew nearer still. Croft fancied Bzad would be surprised at
  their speed, but&mdash;Cathur's standard rippled in the breeze. He would
  think everything well.</p>

  <p>Closer and closer. Croft raised his hand. Two sailors sprang to the rail
  in the waist. They carried grappling hooks attached to ropes. Closer
  still&mdash;</p>

  <p>Croft dropped his hand. The bow of his galley veered.</p>

  <p>Crash! The near bank of oars snapped like straws. The vessels ground
  together. The men in the waist cast their hooks and lashed all fast.</p>

  <p>Bzad appeared on the after-deck. His face was dark, yet he seemed not yet
  to comprehend the full bearing of what had occurred. Lakkon was in full sight
  of the Cathurian galley, and Lakkon, he knew was to be aboard. Kyphallos was
  not visible, but another man in armor was by Lakkon's side.</p>

  <p>Bzad lifted his voice. "What means this?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"There has been a change of plan," Croft returned.</p>

  <p>"A change of plan!" the Mazzerian repeated. "Yes, a change of plan indeed
  it would seem, when you crash into my side and destroy my oars instead of
  crossing my bows as 'twas arranged. Still, small matter. I have others. Where
  is the maid?"</p>

  <p>"Below," said 'Croft, sensing Lakkon stiffen at his side. "Do you wish her
  still?"</p>

  <p>"Do I wish her? Adita, goddess of beauty, was she not promised me for
  myself as a part of the price?" Bzad roared.</p>

  <p>Again Croft lifted an arm. Men appeared with rifles in their hands.</p>

  <p>"Then if so be you wish her, come and take her, aid of Zollaria and man of
  an unclean tribe. If you wish her, come and take her from a ship of Aphur,
  Bzad."</p>

  <p>And now the Mazzerian understood at last. He started back and raised his
  voice: "Aboard them&mdash;strike, slay! We are betrayed. Let none live save
  the maid of the yellow hair!"</p>

  <p>His men were no cowards. They rallied to his cry. Seizing weapons they
  hurled themselves toward the close-lashed rails.</p>

  <p>"Fire," said Croft, as an arrow whistled between himself and Lakkon.</p>

  <p>His men responded with a will. This was the first trial of the new weapon
  in actual war. They fired and loaded and fired again. On board Bzad's vessel
  men fell. They slumped to the deck or toppled back from the rail which they
  had reached.</p>

  <p>Bzad appeared among them. He was beside himself with rage. He sprang on
  the rail. A sailor fired pointblank in his face and missed him. He reached
  the deck and charged with drawn sword toward Lakkon and Croft.</p>

  <p>With a strange tingle running through his entire body. Croft drew his own
  sword and set himself before Aphur's prince. And then, before they could come
  together, Bzad staggered and fell. The sailor had not missed his second
  shot.</p>

  <p>Bzad struggled for a moment. He forced himself halfway up and sank back.
  His limbs twitched oddly for a moment, and he died.</p>

  <p>Beyond him the deck of his own craft was a shambles. Men lay on Croft's
  deck as well, some of them his, more of them Bzad's, of whom no more than six
  survived out of a possible score. Of Croft's none had been killed and the
  whole affair had taken no more than five minutes from beginning to end.</p>

  <p>Croft's voice boomed forth. "Overboard with the dead. Bind the remaining
  men and take them with us. Board the galley and sink it. We shall leave no
  trace of this."</p>

  <p>Then as his men sprang laughing to do his bidding he turned to where
  Lakkon stood by the body of Bzad. "Will you go below and reassure your
  daughter. Prince Lakkon?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Come&mdash;we will go together," Jadgor's brother-in-law replied.</p>

  <p>Croft complied. The two men went below. They entered the quarters where
  Naia sought to look from a tiny port, and Maia crouched in a corner as far
  from the opening as she might.</p>

  <p>"Come, my child," said Aphur's prince; and as she advanced slowly toward
  himself and Croft, stretched out his hand for hers.</p>

  <p>"Behold your lord," he went on and laid her hand in Croft's. "To him shall
  you be given by Magur himself, when this thing is ended. In the meantime
  shall you lie with the Virgins at Zitra, even as he has decreed."</p>

  <p>Naia flushed. A soft color dyed her face and perfect throat. She lowered
  her eyes, and suddenly throwing all reticence aside, she lifted her arms and
  laid them about Croft's neck and raised her lips to his.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Lakkon somewhat aghast. "Naught can keep you from her now
  with honor, Jasor of Nodhur&mdash;my son."</p>

  <p>"Nothing shall keep me from her save death," Croft told him and held her
  very close.</p>

  <p>And lying against him, Naia turned her head. Her eyes were glowing with
  the light of a sacred fire. But she laughed. "My father&mdash;you have called
  him son," she reminded. "Recall that I said you should."</p>

  <p>"I ask no better privilege, my son and daughter," Lakkon yielded with a
  smile. "Zitu himself knows I liked not the other arrangement. He knows, this
  pleases me well."</p>

  <p>The captain tapped on the door. He reported the Mazzerian's galley
  sinking, and the decks as cleared.</p>

  <p>Two minutes later, Croft's vessel was headed for Zitra south by east.
  Behind was an empty sea. If Kyphallos had started a galley to inform Bzad of
  what had occurred at Scira, it was apt to search long and vainly for him it
  was meant to meet.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">XXIV. &mdash; THE DOGS OF WAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WAR! War between Zollaria and Tamarizia! War planned for
  fifty years and now set into motion! It had come as Croft had predicted, as
  Jadgor of Aphur had feared. As though malignly determined to be avenged even
  in death, the bullet-pierced body of Bzad had washed ashore, and been
  discovered. No other pretext was needed by the Empire to the north.</p>

  <p>All other plans they threw by the board. Bzad of Mazzer-a guest of their
  nation had been slain on the Central Sea. They made demands for redress, and
  they asked Cathur as the price of What had just occurred.</p>

  <p>Tamhys of Zitra, with a pained, almost puzzled expression in his aged
  eyes, heard the demands of the envoys and answered them finally not as a man
  of peace but as a patriot of his country, unwilling to see his land
  dismembered to appease an enemy's greed.</p>

  <p>The Na was alive with motor-driven vessels, gathering at Himyra, filling
  its yellow flood with a ready fleet. Aboard them marched men or rolled
  armored motors, soon to have their test on a bloody field. Into them were
  loaded those things Croft had fashioned against this time, rifles and
  ammunition and grenades. Ladhra and Himyra swarmed with marching men.
  Milidhur's two armored cars were rushing overland to join her assembling
  forces. Robur in his glory was loading his expedition for the relief of
  Bithur, where Mazzer was to strike. The gentle Gaya wept, while her war-lord
  girded on his armor and boasted of the fate he would carry among the blue men
  with his death-dealing tools.</p>

  <p>Naia of Aphur was with the Vestals of Zitra, where Croft had left her a
  month before. He had taken her to Zud and explained what he desired. Zud had
  listened and given assent. Their parting had been brief, since Croft knew he
  must hasten back to Himyra and begin the final preparations for what was soon
  to come. Zud knowing her pledged by Lakkon to Croft, had left them alone at
  the last, before he took her to the apartments of the Virgins, close to the
  top of the monster pyramid, where a white flame leaped from oils never
  allowed to diminish in front of a figure of Ga&mdash;the Eternal
  Woman&mdash;brooding over the sacred fire of life.</p>

  <p>Croft stretched forth his arms.</p>

  <p>Naia of Aphur gave him the look of the woman, and laid herself, on his
  breast.</p>

  <p>"Mine," said the man.</p>

  <p>"Yours," said the maid, in a voice like the sighing of a harp. "Promise me
  you shall come again to claim me, Jasor, my lord, whom I love."</p>

  <p>"I shall come to claim you, my Naia, and make you my own," he said.</p>

  <p>"And should you not, no other shall claim me ever," she whispered and
  raised her lips.</p>

  <p>"Naught save death shall keep me," Croft vowed with his lips on hers.</p>

  <p>"I know. If you come not, I stay here forever," she told him, clinging to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Nay." He held her from him to look down into her face. "You shall tend
  the fire for me, rather than Ga."</p>

  <p>"Azil permitting, beloved." And because of the meaning of her own words to
  her soul she colored beneath his eyes.</p>

  <p>Then came Zud and led her to the Vestals, and Croft, full of the divine
  fire of that parting, went back to Himyra to prepare for those things which
  must come to pass ere he might return to her.</p>

  <p>He plunged into the task with the full cooperation of Jadgor, Lakkon, and
  Robur. A swift boat was sent to Zitra to wait any news at that point. Word
  was sent to Milidhur and Ladhra to mobilize their forces and be ready to move
  on the word. At Himyra activities of every nature were pushed. Never had the
  Red City seen such ceaseless preparation as now went on to meet and check
  Zollaria's plans.</p>

  <p>Of those plans Croft kept track, leaving his body at times in the night
  and hovering over Cathur and the northern nation. He knew when the envoys
  left for Zitra to demand Cathur, of Tamhys, as the price of peace. He
  witnessed the massing of her army along Cathur's north frontier. He saw
  Kyphallos at the head of the hastily gathered levies of Cathur, men
  untrained, unready, herded into hasty companies, poorly equipped&mdash;beings
  to be led to the slaughter in a sham of resistance as he knew, before
  Kyphallos did his part and surrendered to what would seem overwhelming forces
  equipped and trained for this moment through a span of fifty years.</p>

  <p>Yet Croft smiled. In all that vast army set aside for this one task by the
  empire which had raised it, there was nothing to compare with the weapons he
  possessed, naught to resemble them in the least. Spears there were and bows,
  cross-bows even, and swords. Chariots there were, and men in glistening
  armor, who drove them. Scythe-like blades armed their wheels to cut and rend
  asunder all who stood in their course. But what were they to his chariots
  which would move themselves across the field of carnage and vomit the fire of
  death into Zollaria's ranks?</p>

  <p>Then came the swift boat from Zitra, reporting Tamhys's answer and the
  return of the envoys north. Tamhys had refused. Croft laughed into Jadgor's
  eyes. Tamhys had asked&mdash;asked that Aphur and Nodhur and Milidhur use
  their full power and their new weapons to make Tamarizia strong.</p>

  <p>"Think, you he would have been so bold had he not known of them?" Jadgor
  growled, with a teeth-baring grin. "Nay by Zitu! If so I do not agreed. 'Twas
  because he knew these things were in our hands, and Tamarizia in our hearts
  he refused.</p>

  <p>"Go!" he cried to the messenger who had but returned. "Say to Tamhys that
  we stand ready&mdash;that we say at once&mdash;that ere Zollaria's men shall
  return with his word, we shall be nearing the northern coast! How say you,
  Jasor, my lord?"</p>

  <p>"Even as Jadgor has said, O King," Croft replied, since this was what he
  had planned.</p>

  <p>That night all Himyra flared with fire. That night the sound of marching
  feet, the rumble of motors filled the Red City's streets. The firelight
  struck on the motors' metal bodies, glinted on the slanting barrels of the
  rifles carried by Aphur's sons. A swift car had flown to Ladhra carrying the
  word. In Ladhra, too, the night was filled with embarkation of the forces
  which were to join with Aphur in the north.</p>

  <p>At break of day Croft, Jadgor and Lakkon sailed. That afternoon Ladhra's
  first contingent arrived. Then Robur sent part on the heels of the former
  fleet, and took part in his own party, to Bithur's aid. Belzor himself led
  the section which hurried after Croft. He reported the motor transports as
  already whirling the bulk of the troops for Milidhur's aid toward the
  east.</p>

  <p>In three days Croft made landfall on the coast of Mazhur not far from
  Niera and coasted toward the town, after landing a party under Lakkon some
  miles above it with instructions to advance down the coast, and entrench
  themselves on the landward side of the city, at once. He appeared before the
  city with his fleet about mid-morning and demanded its surrender at once.</p>

  <p>His answer was defiance, of course.</p>

  <p>Croft set to work. His own galley ran close in toward the gates of the
  harbor. The enemy manned the walls. They began a rain of arrows and spears
  and the casting down of fireballs, hoping to set the galley on
  fire.</p><a id="pic3"
        name="pic3"></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0801081h-images/Palos-3.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Croft had expected this. He had prepared some metal shields which could be
  used to cover the decks against arrows and spears from above. They were
  impregnable save for some square-cut holes. Through these he began a
  bombardment of the gates themselves with grenades. Heavy as they were, they
  had not been built to resist the assault of powder. Inside twenty minutes,
  while the air filled with shouts and missiles of the defenders, one was blown
  from its hinges and fell with a mighty splash. The other followed shortly
  after. Croft's galley sailed in, followed by that of Jadgor and several
  others of the fleet.</p>

  <p>And now he had the defenders of the walls in the rear. His galley paused.
  The others followed suit. Their decks swarmed with men who knelt and opened
  fire from the rifles Croft had made. A smell of powder filled the air.
  Smoke-clouds floated in the air. The shouts of the defenders changed to cries
  of alarm as they found themselves stricken by this new and unknown force.
  Other galleys forced passage and, speeding beyond the engaged vessels, opened
  a galling fire along the waterfront. Under cover of this landing parties were
  flung ashore. They marched into the town, engaging the Zollarian guards
  wherever found, yet always at an advantage of weapons and range. In an hour
  it was done.</p>

  <p>The Zollarian commander surrendered. Croft shut his men in their barracks
  and posted a guard. Bulletins printed in advance, promising freedom from harm
  to all non-combatants who kept their houses and caused no trouble, were
  affixed at the houses at the corners of the streets. The remainder of the
  fleet entered the harbor and debarked their men and the armored, motors.
  Inside two hours more Croft marched out of the landward gate and joined
  Lakkon and his men where they had labored on their trenches. That night
  Jadgor's tent stood in the midst of an armed camp on Mazhurian soil.
  Tamarizia had struck swiftly and with an overwhelming force, for which
  Zollaria had been unprepared.</p>

  <p>The next day the men of Ladhra arrived. Croft left them to garrison Niera
  until a later body from the interior parts of Aphur should arrive, then
  follow on. In fact he left orders that as each new contingent appeared they
  should take over Niera, releasing the garrison they found to advance through
  the state in support of his main force.</p>

  <p>Himself he broke camp and moved inland along the splendid roads which
  Tamarizia had built generations unnumbered before, when Mazhur was one of her
  states.</p>

  <p>For Palos, the sight was odd as the well-drilled ranks moved ahead in
  steady cadence, with here and there a huge ungainly battle motor rumbling
  along, its monster body filled with men. Here and there in some minor town
  some slight resistance was met. The motors took care of that. Rolling
  irresistibly forward into a slithering flight of arrows and spears, they spat
  fire at the defenders until they fell or fled.</p>

  <p>On and on crept the column with scarcely a pause save for rest or food.
  That word of it went before it Croft did not doubt. He even smiled grimly as
  he suggested to Jadgor what that word would be&mdash;a garbled version of
  monsters which breathed fire and slew with their breath, of troops which shot
  not arrows but more of the monsters' fire.</p>

  <p>And Jadgor smiled in return as he gazed down the sturdily swinging ranks
  that crept along the road the lumbering motors had cleared.</p>

  <p>Luckily there were few streams, for the Zollarians seemed to understand
  dimly by what they were attacked. They destroyed what bridges lay in the line
  of their retreat. Some of them had to be repaired, thereby losing time. Thus,
  as he advanced, Croft found the countryside cleared and sensed that the
  retreating forces were trusting to the main body, when they reached it, to
  check his victorious course.</p>

  <p>He had some swift motors in which he himself and Jadgor and Lakkon rode.
  Taking one of these, he sent it far ahead to feel out the road. In it he
  placed a picked squad of his very best marksmen and ordered them to return at
  all costs should they contact the enemy in force. But the enemy in force was
  attacking the frontier of Cathur. That was as Croft had planned it. That was
  Zollaria's second mistake, even as her first was in not knowing the full
  weight of the power she faced.</p>

  <p>Thus days passed and the Tamarizian army had actually reached the northern
  bounds of Mazhur itself, as Jadgor declared, before any news of the main
  enemy body was received.</p>

  <p>Then the scout-motor came back and reported heavy forces hurrying to
  intercept their present line of march.</p>

  <p>Croft ordered a halt and took stock of the situation. Before him was a
  defile in the hills, through which ran the road to reach a farther plain. And
  that was enough. He ordered an advance. Deploying his army right and left, he
  set them to digging trenches along the hillside so as to enfilade the plain
  from both sides of the central pass. In these he posted the riflemen and one
  of his trained grenade corps every fifty feet.</p>

  <p>Across the road he built a barricade, some way back on the front-line
  trench. High on each side of the pass he posted other riflemen behind
  shelters of stone in such a position that they could fire into the road or
  cast down grenades. In front of the barricade itself he parked his
  battle-motors, unseen from the plain, but ready to emerge upon it when the
  time should come.</p>

  <p>He was hard at it in the midst of these arrangements when a band of
  Zollarians mounted on gnuppas appeared above a gentle swell in the road,
  perhaps a mile away, sat watching the work along the hillside for some
  moments, turned and disappeared in the direction from whence they had
  come.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">XXV. &mdash; WHEN HELMOR'S SUN SET</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"THEY come, O Jadgor of Aphur!" Lakkon said.</p>

  <p>"Let them," Croft flung but, from a wonderful confidence. "You shall see
  their slaughter, O king."</p>

  <p>The hosts of Zollaria appeared. From the top of the hill above the road
  Croft and the other two watched. Foot and chariots, the men of the northern
  nation began to top the rolling hill before them. It was mid-afternoon. The
  sunlight sparkled upon spear point and chariot, on cuirass and plume-tufted
  helm.</p>

  <p>It was a wonderful sight as the soldiers of the empire prepared to hurl
  themselves against the smaller force which held the pass and the hills to
  either side. They deployed right and left, spearmen, bowmen, with a chariot
  filled with some noble and his driver here and there along the far-flung
  front. And, having deployed, they began a slow advance, moving like a mighty
  living ocean toward the shoreline of the hills. Prisoners were to tell Croft
  later they were sorely puzzled by the scant sight of the enemy they
  obtained.</p>

  <p>The trenches, wherein lurked the waiting death they faced, baffled their
  understanding, were new in their knowledge of war. Their captains knew not
  exactly what they led them against. Yet they were proud in their might and
  the training of fifty years for this moment.</p>

  <p>Men had lived and been trained and had died and handed down the tradition
  of this day to their sons who were being trained to take their father's
  places in the ranks when the day should come. Now they advanced without
  hesitation to write the history of the day itself upon their nation's
  page.</p>

  <p>Croft turned to Jadgor and Lakkon. "You command the wings," he said. "I
  shall lead the motors. The next hour shall make us freemen or slaves. Say as
  much to your men."</p>

  <p>He began the descent of the hill, reached the motors, each with its load
  of tensely waiting soldiers, and entered his own&mdash;the first and leading
  car.</p>

  <p>He gave the command. The motors roared. A faint cheer broke from the lips
  of the men behind the barricade. The armored cars gained speed. They left the
  defile of the pass. Suddenly they broke upon the sight of the Zollarian
  host.</p>

  <p>For a moment it seemed to falter all along the line as the motors left the
  road and deployed now in their turn to right and left. Then, with a shout, a
  flashing chariot dashed from their ranks and headed with plunging gnuppas at
  Croft's own machine. Crash! Crash! Two of the gnuppas were down. The chariot
  was overturned in a smother of dust and flying hoofs as the stricken
  creatures dragged their teammates with them in their fall. Croft's motor
  advanced. The whole line of unwieldy shapes rolled forward. They began to
  spit acrid smoke and flame.</p><a id="pic4"
        name="pic4"></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0801081h-images/Palos-4.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Crash, crash! The trenches opened fire, shooting above the moving motors
  toward the Zollarians' ranks.</p>

  <p>Men went down in a swift dissolution. Some one sounded the charge.
  Zollaria's manhood answered the summon to their manhood. They surged ahead in
  a roaring human flood. The motors were engulfed, but still they spat fire.
  Men gathered about them and sought to, overturn them. They died. The press of
  the charge passed toward the hill. The motors lumbered about and fired into
  the rear of the storming forces. They squatted on the plain and sent a stream
  of death into the backs of their foes. And in the faces of those foes a
  stream of death was pouring. Rifles blazed and grenades began exploding along
  the sides of the hills. Still they stormed up. This was Zollaria's
  day&mdash;<i>the day</i>&mdash;the thing they dreamed of, planned for,
  through fifty years.</p>

  <p>Only by degrees could the thought of certain success begin to waver in the
  minds of the men in that charge. Some of them died on the hillside. Some of
  them reached to the lip of the trenches themselves and died. Some of them
  entered the defile and found the barricade and died before it under the blast
  of its rifles and the grenades hurled down upon them from its edge. And all
  the while the glistening motors squatted on the plain or ambled slowly toward
  the hillsides, spitting flame, while other men died.</p>

  <p>So in the end Zollaria's men began at first to doubt and then to fear. In
  front was death, and death was at their backs. Turn where they would that
  fiery, unknown, roaring death spat at them. The air was full of it. The very
  ground seemed to leap into flame at their feet and carry death. They wavered.
  They turned. They fled. Bowmen, spearmen, chariot, and plume-tossing gnuppa,
  they streamed down the hillside and out on the plain. And after them came
  death&mdash;and death met them again from the metal-covered motors, which
  fired and fired into their mass as they retreated in fear.</p>

  <p>Croft saw them vanish over the rolling hill which had veiled their recent
  advance. He opened the door of his motor and called through a trumpet to two
  of the cars by number. They were under command of trusted men. He ordered
  them to take each two others and follow the beaten army, giving it neither
  respite nor ease while daylight should last. Himself he returned to the
  defile. It was a great hour, the greatest hour he had ever known in his
  life&mdash;the hour in which all he had promised was proven, all he had
  worked for was won. He climbed down and mounted the hill to where Jadgor
  stood.</p>

  <p>"O king," he said. "To you for Tamarizia, I give back Mazhur, the lost
  state. Another meeting such as this and, I think, Zollaria will surely sue
  for peace."</p>

  <p>Jadgor reached out and embraced him&mdash;to Croft's surprise. "Jasor of
  Nodhur&mdash;man of wonder!" he exclaimed. "Did, I ever doubt Zitu had sent
  you to Tamarizia's salvation I do not doubt it now."</p>

  <p>That night Croft camped where he was. The next day Belzor, with his
  Nodhurians, having made a forced march from Niera, came up. Gazing on the
  body-strewn hillside and plain he wept with disappointment not to have been
  present to witness what took place.</p>

  <p>Croft grinned. "Patience. The emperor himself leads the army against
  Cathur, some of the captives tell me. Today we advance."</p>

  <p>Toward midnight his motors had come back to report the enemy still in
  flight and the road a mass of wounded who had fallen from exhaustion on the
  way. Croft's heart went out to the poor devils, who were, after all, but the
  victims of their ruler's lust for power. Yet he could do little for them
  because of the lack of time and the fact that he passed through openly
  hostile territory now.</p>

  <p>It had been somewhat different in Mazhur, where many of the inhabitants
  were Tamarizian still at heart. But here, should he leave men behind to
  attend the wounded, he knew, that if discovered, they would perish without
  any doubt. Hence beyond collecting them in one place, supplying them with
  provisions, and leaving the lesser wounded to wait upon the others, he could
  do nothing before he advanced on the main body of the enemy.</p>

  <p>That advance lasted for a week. Twice, during it Croft left his body,
  satisfied himself the state of things was safe, returned to earth, and
  chatted with Mrs. Goss and went back. At the end of the week he found himself
  once more facing a foe.</p>

  <p>His first victory had produced a wonderful effect. Zollaria, driving
  Cathur before her like chaff, under Kyphallos's treacherous leadership, had
  made progress already, when word of Croft's landing and advance from Niera
  had caused the Emperor Helmor to detach a portion of his army under his son
  to crush the flank attack. Instead, his son's command was crushed and
  recoiled in a sorry rout. Helmor faced about. Raging at this check to his
  plans, he rushed north and east to finish the Tamarizian army himself.</p>

  <p>And now Croft found the positions reversed. Helmor chose his own ground.
  He set himself to withstand the shock of battle along a line of gently
  rolling hills, up which his foe must advance to the attack. Thus his bowmen
  had a tremendous advantage, according to all his knowledge of war, and his
  spearmen, at close quarters, could give a most magnificent account of
  themselves, while the chariots, in the rear of the line, could take care of
  any small bands of the enemy which might chance to break through.</p>

  <p>In this case Croft put his motors in the front. Deploying his men, he
  instructed them to advance by rushes, keeping well in the rear of the sixteen
  machines, yet close enough to take advantage of any breaks they made in
  Helmor's line.</p>

  <p>"This day will be the last," he said to Jadgor as he prepared to lead in
  his own machine.</p>

  <p>"Zitu grant it, and victory with it!" Jadgor replied. "Should you carry
  defeat to Helmor, Tamarizia is yours, to do with as you please. Once before,
  I would remind you, Jasor, I said well-nigh as much."</p>

  <p>"There is but one thing in Tamarizia I desire." Croft looked at Lakkon as
  he spoke and smiled.</p>

  <p>"It is yours, my son," said Aphur's prince, and spoke softly to Jadgor.
  "What think you, O king? Our Jasor desires a maid."</p>

  <p>And Jadgor nodded. "Aye, Lakkon, I am not a fool! You are willing she
  should go to him?"</p>

  <p>"I have pledged her to him," said Lakkon as he bowed his head.</p>

  <p>"And I go to win her now," said Croft as he entered his car.</p>

  <p>Naia of Aphur. That was the cry of his heart he carried into the fight.
  Naia of Aphur. This fight should make her his. He gave the signal for the
  advance with a smile upon his lips.</p>

  <p>Like huge metal turtles the motors began crawling toward the hill where
  Helmor waited. Slowly, steadily, as implacable as fate, they rumbled ahead.
  And, after a time, their breath rose on the air of the cloudless morning in
  acrid whiffs of smoke. Flights of arrows and crossbow bolts rattled on their
  sides and fell harmless. They reached the foot of the hill and began to
  climb&mdash;up and up. They were half lost now in the smoke of their own
  fierce discharges and the clouds of flying shafts.</p>

  <p>Back of them the infantry advanced as Croft directed, dashing forward a
  hundred yards, and dropping down to fire in crashing volleys which covered
  their comrades' sprinting rush, rising again and swarming ahead while the
  other end of their companies covered them in turn. On the hill confusion
  began to develop after a time. Men fell in heaps with a chance to strike
  back.</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer, without pause, the odd metal turtles crept up the hill.
  Nothing stopped them. Nothing, neither valor nor marksmanship, silenced the
  deadly spitting of their fire. Arrows broke upon them, cross-bolts, slithered
  off their invulnerable hides. Nearer and nearer crept the menace of their
  ugly snouts.</p>

  <p>On the right flank two reached the Zollarian line and crashed against it.
  Men fell and were ground into bloody pulp beneath metal wheels. The
  Zollarians tried. They flung themselves in waves upon the monsters. They
  sought to climb upon them. They gripped at the spitting rifle-barrels. But
  still the motors plowed on in a bloody foam. They turned and began crawling
  through the sea of men. Flesh and bone could stand no more. The right flank
  wavered and fled just before the infantry, swarming up the slope in a final
  rush, drove its own charge home. They fell back in a disorganized mob,
  flinging bows and spears from them as they ran.</p>

  <p>They left the center unsupported, attacked from both front and side. It
  wavered, bent, sought to turn itself to meet the double- attack, broke in the
  process, and split asunder. Behind it, in his gorgeous chariot, Helmor raged
  to no avail. Through the mle a monster thing of metal bore down upon him.
  From it there came a brazen voice as of one speaking through a trumpet:</p>

  <p>"Yield, Helmor of Zollaria, and put a stop to slaughter! Yield, Helmor, or
  perish with your men!"</p>

  <p>This was the end. This was the fruition in blood and despair of that day
  prepared against through the span of fifty years. Thus was Zollaria's
  ambition sinking to destruction, smothered beneath the swirling dust of a
  panic-stricken ruck. Helmor swept the lost field with his eyes and knew the
  truth.</p>

  <p>He gave the sign of surrender, spoke to his frightened aides, and sent
  them galloping on gnuppas right and left to carry the word of defeat. A
  standard shot up from the top of Croft's car. The sounds of battle ceased by
  degrees and died as car after car raised a similar signal across the
  battle-front.</p>

  <p>Croft opened the door of his car and stepped down. "You will enter, Helmor
  of Zollaria," he said shortly, and gestured to the door.</p>

  <p>The Emperor Helmor bowed. He bent his haughty crest and disappeared from
  sight. The door closed behind him, shutting him safe beyond all dreams of
  conquest for all time to come. The great car turned and lumbered back down
  the hill toward the camp where Jadgor of Aphur had waited and watched. The
  sun was at its zenith above a field of dead and wounded. But Helmor's sun of
  ambition had set.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">XXVI. &mdash; THE CONSUMMATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THESE are the things Croft told me.</p>

  <p>It was three o'clock in the morning when he was done. "That was a month
  ago, Dr. Murray," he said, and sighed.</p>

  <p>"But what became of Kyphallos?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Croft smiled.</p>

  <p>"Kyphallos was placed under arrest and tried with speed," he replied. "He
  was sentenced to exile in that Zollaria he had tried to aid in her plans. He
  went forth in a rather boastful fashion and appeared at the capital, Berla,
  itself. But neither Helmor nor the tawny Kalamita would have aught to do with
  him, since he could be of no further use to them. Only then I think did
  Kyphallos realize his true position, because then he drew himself up before
  Kalamita and asked her, for all time, to say he was nothing to her.</p>

  <p>"She replied with a sneering laugh.</p>

  <p>"Kyphallos gave her one look, drew his sword, held it before his breast,
  and fell upon it and died."</p>

  <p>"And the maid?" I asked. "Pardon me, Croft, but I'm human! And like all
  human beings I recognize love as the mainspring of existence."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "As it is&mdash;love, Murray, is life&mdash;the cause of all
  being. The maid is mine, or shall be so, soon as I return."</p>

  <p>"You're going back?" I said.</p>

  <p>He gave me a glance. "Of course. I ask nothing better. God, man, don't you
  understand that she waits for me&mdash;there? Oh, yes, I've seen her since
  Zollaria was beaten! I've held her in my arms&mdash;felt her lips. The
  wedding-day is set. It is to be in Himyra, with Magur as the priest. Man,
  can't you understand?"</p>

  <p>"What?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>His laugh came again. But it was nervous. "You rather force me to blow my
  own horn. Murray, I'm Tamarizia today. When we returned to Zitra victors and
  learned that Robur had driven the Mazzerians like chaff before the wind, and
  that Milidhur, outside of a skirmish or two, had found nothing to do, Tamhys
  gave me new rank. He named me Prince of Zitra, a title never known in
  Tamarizia before, but next in importance to the imperial throne. Man, I could
  have been emperor had I wished since Tamhys's term expired one week after we
  got back."</p>

  <p>"Could have been?" I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes." He smiled. "But&mdash;I didn't take it. Do you know what I
  did?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly." I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"You might deduce it," he returned. "Murray, Tamarizia is a republic now.
  She was ready for it. She had come nearly to it before I arrived. There was
  no reason why she should not set up a true democracy. When they offered me
  the crown I replied, with a request. I called for a council of the states. I
  put the thing squarely before them. They hailed the suggestion with acclaim.
  My word was law, Murray&mdash;law.</p>

  <p>"Last night when you called me back and I returned, do you know what was
  being done? Certainly not. But&mdash;we were completing the draft of the
  republican constitution. Nothing less. When I returned I found them clustered
  about me&mdash;those nobles of the nation. They thought me in a faint, all
  save Jadgor and Lakkon and Robur, of course. I caught their eyes and knew
  they understood. But I said nothing, and we finished the draft last
  night.</p>

  <p>"Now Jasor's body, which I have used, lies in Zud's own room in the Zitra
  pyramid. It is guarded by a priest. Above it, between it and the Temple of
  Zitu, Murray, between it and God, Naia of Aphur is waiting, a virgin guarded
  by Virgins for my return, in that room where Ga, the eternal woman, broods
  above the sacred fire. Think you I shall not go back?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I think I would go myself if I could," I replied.</p>

  <p>His eyes filled with a far-away look.</p>

  <p>"Earth is beautiful," he said. "I love it, its mountains and valleys, its
  streams and lakes, its fields of grass and flowers, but, Murray&mdash;there
  is something, some one now in my life I love beyond anything else. Man, I
  have found my mate. Like the moose of the great woods, I must answer her
  call.</p>

  <p>"I shall go back. I shall make Naia of Aphur my wife. There, will be an
  election to select a president of the new republic. I have been asked to put
  up my name. I think&mdash;no, Murray, I am sure, that Naia shall be the first
  lady of all Tamarizia at Zitra itself before long."</p>

  <p>"And your body here? What will you do? Shall you tell her the truth?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think so," he declared. "Truth is a wonderful thing. It should be
  kept sacred between a man and his mate. Were that done more commonly by man
  and his consort half the marital trouble of the world would disappear.
  But&mdash;what need have I of an earthly body any more?</p>

  <p>"My life calls me to Palos. Henceforth I am through with earth. Hence,
  Murray, my friend, when I return from this final excursion, I shall do what I
  have never done before. I shall snap the invisible bond between this body and
  my spirit, which, until now, I have held intact. I shall remain here a very
  few days to perform some necessary tasks. I must provide for Mrs. Goss, and I
  desire my estate to be given to some foundation for the welfare of my race.
  Then&mdash;then, Murray&mdash;I shall go to the woman I
  love&mdash;Naia&mdash;my God-given mate!"</p>

  <p>THIS is the story he told me that afternoon and night. Was he sane? I
  think so. Was the story true? I cannot say. And yet somewhere I feel that
  Jason Croft is living today&mdash;that he is happy, that he has won his great
  adventure, and that Naia of Aphur, that maid of the golden hair and purple
  eyes, is truly now his wife.</p>

  <p>One thing I can set down with positive knowledge at the end. A week from
  the first time she called me, Mrs. Goss came to me again. I went with her to
  the great couch in Croft's study and&mdash;I found him dead! His body lay
  there lifeless, rigid and cold beyond any power of mine to help. It came over
  me that the man had kept his word, and broken the subtle thread between it
  and his spirit, just as he had said he would. I straightened and told Mrs.
  Goss there was nothing I could do.</p>

  <p>She wiped her dark, old eyes. "I knowed it," she said, "I knowed it!
  Somethin' told me I was goin' to lose him this time! I've knowed him from a
  baby, Dr. Murray. He was always a very strange man."</p>
