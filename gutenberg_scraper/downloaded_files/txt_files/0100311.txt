PREFATORY NOTE

This book needs a preliminary note that its scope be not misunderstood
The view suggested is historical rather than theological, and does not
deal directly with a religious change which has been the chief event
of my own life; and about which I am already writing a more purely
controversial volume. It is impossible, I hope, for any Catholic to
write any book on any subject, above all this subject, without showing
that he is a Catholic; but this study is not specially concerned with
the differences between a Catholic and a Protestant. Much of it is
devoted to many sorts of Pagans rather than any sort of Christians; and
its thesis is that those who say that Christ stands side by side with
similar myths, and his religion side by side with similar religions,
are only repeating a very stale formula contradicted by a very striking
fact. To suggest this I have not needed to go much beyond matters
known to us all; I make no claim to learning; and have to depend for
some things, as has rather become the fashion, on those who are more
learned. As I have more than once differed from Mr. H. G. Wells in his
view of history, it is the more right that I should here congratulate
him on the courage and constructive imagination which carried through
his vast and varied and intensely interesting work; but still more on
having asserted the reasonable right of the amateur to do what he can
with the facts which the specialists provide.

INTRODUCTION

THE PLAN OF THIS BOOK

There are two ways of getting home; and one of them is to stay there.
The other is to walk round the whole world till we come back to the
same place; and I tried to trace such a journey in a story I once
wrote. It is, however, a relief to turn from that topic to another
story that I never wrote. Like every book I never wrote, it is by far
the best book I have ever written. It is only too probable that I shall
never write it, so I will use it symbolically here; for it was a symbol
of the same truth. I conceived it as a romance of those vast valleys
with sloping sides, like those along which the ancient White Horses
of Wessex are scrawled along the flanks of the hills. It concerned
some boy whose farm or cottage stood on such a slope, and who went on
his travels to find something, such as the effigy and grave of some
giant; and when he was far enough from home he looked back and saw
that his own farm and kitchen-garden, shining flat on the hill-side
like the colours and quarterings of a shield, were but parts of some
such gigantic figure, on which he had always lived, but which was too
large and too close to be seen. That, I think, is a true picture of the
progress of any really independent intelligence today; and that is the
point of this book.

The point of this book, in other words, is that the next best thing
to being really inside Christendom is to be really outside it. And a
particular point of it is that the popular critics of Christianity are
not really outside it. They are on a debatable ground, in every sense
of the term. They are doubtful in their very doubts. Their criticism
has taken on a curious tone; as of a random and illiterate heckling.
Thus they make current and anti-clerical cant as a sort of small-talk.
They will complain of parsons dressing like parsons; as if we should
be any more free if all the police who shadowed or collared us were
plain clothes detectives. Or they will complain that a sermon cannot
be interrupted, and call a pulpit a coward's castle; though they do
not call an editor's office a coward's castle. It would be unjust both
to journalists and priests; but it would be much truer of journalist.
The clergyman appears in person and could easily be kicked as he came
out of church; the journalist conceals even his name so that nobody
can kick him. They write wild and pointless articles and letters in
the press about why the churches are empty, without even going there
to find out if they are empty, or which of them are empty. Their
suggestions are more vapid and vacant than the most insipid curate
in a three-act farce, and move us to comfort him after the manner of
the curate in the Bab Ballads; 'Your mind is not so blank as that of
Hopley Porter.' So we may truly say to the very feeblest cleric: 'Your
mind is not so blank as that of Indignant Layman or Plain Man or Man
in the Street, or any of your critics in the newspapers; for they
have not the most shadowy notion of what they want themselves. Let
alone of what you ought to give them.' They will suddenly turn round
and revile the Church for not having prevented the War, which they
themselves did not want to prevent; and which nobody had ever professed
to be able to prevent, except some of that very school of progressive
and cosmopolitan sceptics who are the chief enemies of the Church. It
was the anti-clerical and agnostic world that was always prophesying
the advent of universal peace; it is that world that was, or should
have been, abashed and confounded by the advent of universal war. As
for the general view that the Church was discredited by the War--they
might as well say that the Ark was discredited by the Flood. When
the world goes wrong, it proves rather that the Church is right. The
Church is justified, not because her children do not sin, but because
they do. But that marks their mood about the whole religious tradition
they are in a state of reaction against it. It is well with the boy
when he lives on his father's land; and well with him again when he
is far enough from it to look back on it and see it as a whole. But
these people have got into an intermediate state, have fallen into an
intervening valley from which they can see neither the heights beyond
them nor the heights behind. They cannot get out of the penumbra of
Christian controversy. They cannot be Christians and they can not leave
off being Anti-Christians. Their whole atmosphere is the atmosphere of
a reaction: sulks, perversity, petty criticism. They still live in the
shadow of the faith and have lost the light of the faith.

Now the best relation to our spiritual home is to be near enough to
love it. But the next best is to be far enough away not to hate it.
It is the contention of these pages that while the best judge of
Christianity is a Christian, the next best judge would be something
more like a Confucian. The worst judge of all is the man now most ready
with his judgements; the ill-educated Christian turning gradually into
the ill-tempered agnostic, entangled in the end of a feud of which he
never understood the beginning, blighted with a sort of hereditary
boredom with he knows not what, and already weary of hearing what he
has never heard. He does not judge Christianity calmly as a Confucian
would; he does not judge it as he would judge Confucianism. He cannot
by an effort of fancy set the Catholic Church thousands of miles away
in strange skies of morning and judge it as impartially as a Chinese
pagoda. It is said that the great St. Francis Xavier, who very nearly
succeeded in setting up the Church there as a tower overtopping all
pagodas, failed partly because his followers were accused by their
fellow missionaries of representing the Twelve Apostles with the garb
or attributes of Chinamen. But it would be far better to see them
as Chinamen, and judge them fairly as Chinamen, than to see them as
featureless idols merely made to be battered by iconoclasts; or rather
as cockshies to be pelted by empty-handed cockneys. It would be better
to see the whole thing as a remote Asiatic cult; the mitres of its
bishops as the towering head dresses of mysterious bonzes; its pastoral
staffs as the sticks twisted like serpents carried in some Asiatic
procession; to see the prayer book as fantastic as the prayer-wheel
and the Cross as crooked as the Swastika. Then at least we should not
lose our temper as some of the sceptical critics seem to lose their
temper, not to mention their wits. Their anti-clericalism has become
an atmosphere, an atmosphere of negation and hostility from which
they cannot escape. Compared with that, it would be better to see the
whole thing as something belonging to another continent, or to another
planet. It would be more philosophical to stare indifferently at bonzes
than to be perpetually and pointlessly grumbling at bishops. It would
be better to walk past a church as if it were a pagoda than to stand
permanently in the porch, impotent either to go inside and help or
to go outside and forget. For those in whom a mere reaction has thus
become an obsession, I do seriously recommend the imaginative effort of
conceiving the Twelve Apostles as Chinamen. In other words, I recommend
these critics to try to do as much justice to Christian saints as if
they were Pagan sages.

But with this we come to the final and vital point I shall try to show
in these pages that when we do make this imaginative effort to see the
whole thing from the outside, we find that it really looks like what is
traditionally said about it inside. It is exactly when the boy gets far
enough off to see the giant that he sees that he really is a giant. It
is exactly when we do at last see the Christian Church afar under those
clear and level eastern skies that we see that it is really the Church
of Christ. To put it shortly, the moment we are really impartial about
it, we know why people are partial to it. But this second proposition
requires more serious discussion; and I shall here set myself to
discuss it.

As soon as I had clearly in my mind this conception of something solid
in the solitary and unique character of the divine story, it struck me
that there was exactly the same strange and yet solid character in the
human story that had led up to it; because that human story also had a
root that was divine. I mean that just as the Church seems to grow more
remarkable when it is fairly compared with the common religious life
of mankind, so mankind itself seems to grow more remarkable when we
compare it with the common life of nature. And I have noticed that most
modern history is driven to something like sophistry, first to soften
the sharp transition from animals to men, and then to soften the sharp
transition from heathens to Christians. Now the more we really read in
a realistic spirit of those two transitions the sharper we shall find
them to be. It is because the critics are not detached that they do not
see this detachment; it is because they are not looking at things in a
dry light that they cannot see the difference between black and white.
It is because they are in a particular mood of reaction and revolt that
they have a motive for making out that all the white is dirty grey and
the black not so black as it is painted. I do not say there are not
human excuses for their revolt; I do not say it is not in some ways
sympathetic; what I say is that it is not in any way scientific. An
iconoclast may be indignant; an iconoclast may be justly indignant; but
an iconoclast is not impartial. And it is stark hypocrisy to pretend
that nine-tenths of the higher critics and scientific evolutionists
and professors of comparative religion are in the least impartial.
Why should they be impartial, what is being impartial, when the whole
world is at war about whether one thing is a devouring superstition
or a divine hope? I do not pretend to be impartial in the sense that
the final act of faith fixes a man's mind because it satisfies his
mind. But I do profess to be a great deal more impartial than they
are; in the sense that I can tell the story fairly, with some sort of
imaginative justice to all sides; and they cannot. I do profess to be
impartial in the sense that I should be ashamed to talk such nonsense
about the Lama of Thibet as they do about the Pope of Rome, or to have
as little sympathy with Julian the Apostate as they have with the
Society of Jesus. They are not impartial; they never by any chance hold
the historical scales even; and above all they are never impartial upon
this point of evolution and transition. They suggest everywhere the
grey gradations of twilight, because they believe it is the twilight of
the gods. I propose to maintain that whether or no it is the twilight
of gods, it is not the daylight of men.

I maintain that when brought out into the daylight these two things
look altogether strange and unique; and that it is only in the false
twilight of an imaginary period of transition that they can be made
to look in the least like anything else. The first of these is the
creature called man and the second is the man called Christ. I have
therefore divided this book into two parts: the former being a sketch
of the main adventure of the human race in so far as it remained
heathen; and the second a summary of the real difference that was made
by it becoming Christian. Both motives necessitate a certain method, a
method which is not very easy to manage, and perhaps even less easy to
define or defend.

In order to strike, in the only sane or possible sense, the note of
impartiality, it is necessary to touch the nerve of novelty. I mean
that in one sense we see things fairly when we see them first. That,
I may remark in passing, is why children generally have very little
difficulty about the dogmas of the Church. But the Church, being a
highly practical thing for working and fighting, is necessarily a
thing for men and not merely for children. There must be in it for
working purposes a great deal of tradition, of familiarity, and even of
routine. So long as its fundamentals are sincerely felt, this may even
be the saner condition. But when its fundamentals are doubted, as at
present, we must try to recover the candour and wonder of the child;
the unspoilt realism and objectivity of innocence. Or if we cannot do
that, we must try at least to shake off the cloud of mere custom and
see the thing as new, if only by seeing it as unnatural. Things that
may well be familiar so long as familiarity breeds affection had much
better become unfamiliar when familiarity breeds contempt. For in
connection with things so great as are here considered, whatever our
view of them, contempt must be a mistake. Indeed contempt must be an
illusion. We must invoke the most wild and soaring sort of imagination;
the imagination that can see what is there.

The only way to suggest the point is by an example of something,
indeed of almost anything, that has been considered beautiful or
wonderful. George Wyndham once told me that he had seen one of the
first aeroplanes rise for the first time and it was very wonderful but
not so wonderful as a horse allowing a man to ride on him. Somebody
else has said that a fine man on a fine horse is the noblest bodily
object in the world. Now, so long as people feel this in the right
way, all is well. The first and best way of appreciating it is to
come of people with a tradition of treating animals properly; of men
in the right relation to horses. A boy who remembers his father who
rode a horse, who rode it well and treated it well, will know that the
relation can be satisfactory and will be satisfied. He will be all the
more indignant at the ill-treatment of horses because he knows how
they ought to be treated; but he will see nothing but what is normal
in a man riding on a horse. He will not listen to the great modern
philosopher who explains to him that the horse ought to be riding
on the man. He will not pursue the pessimist fancy of Swift and say
that men must be despised as monkeys and horses worshipped as gods.
And horse and man together making an image that is to him human and
civilised, it will be easy, as it were, to lift horse and man together
into something heroic or symbolical; like a vision of St. George in
the clouds. The fable of the winged horse will not be wholly unnatural
to him: and he will know why Ariosto set many a Christian hero in such
an airy saddle, and made him the rider of the sky. For the horse has
really been lifted up along with the man in the wildest fashion in the
very word we use when we speak 'chivalry.' The very name of the horse
has been given to the highest mood and moment of the man; so that we
might almost say that the handsomest compliment to a man is to call him
a horse.

But if a man has got into a mood in which he is not able to feel this
sort of wonder, then his cure must begin right at the other end.
We must now suppose that he has drifted into a dull mood, in which
somebody sitting on a horse means no more than somebody sitting on a
chair. The wonder of which Wyndham spoke, the beauty that made the
thing seem an equestrian statue, the meaning of the more chivalric
horseman, may have become to him merely a convention and a bore.
Perhaps they have been merely a fashion; perhaps they have gone out of
fashion; perhaps they have been talked about too much or talked about
in the wrong way; perhaps it was then difficult to care for horses
without the horrible risk of being horsy. Anyhow, he has got into a
condition when he cares no more for a horse than for a towel-horse. His
grandfather's charge at Balaclava seems to him as dull and dusty as the
album containing such family portraits. Such a person has not really
become enlightened about the album; on the contrary, he has only become
blind with the dust. But when he has reached that degree of blindness,
he will not be able to look at a horse or a horseman at all until he
has seen the whole thing as a thing entirely unfamiliar and almost
unearthly.

Out of some dark forest under some ancient dawn there must come towards
us, with lumbering yet dancing motions, one of the very queerest of the
prehistoric creatures. We must see for the first time the strangely
small head set on a neck not only longer but thicker than itself, as
the face of a gargoyle is thrust out upon a gutter-spout, the one
disproportionate crest of hair running along the ridge of that heavy
neck like a beard in the wrong place; the feet, each like a solid club
of horn, alone amid the feet of so many cattle; so that the true fear
is to be found in showing, not the cloven, but the uncloven hoof. Nor
is it mere verbal fancy to see him thus as a unique monster; for in
a sense a monster means what is unique, and he is really unique. But
the point is that when we thus see him as the first man saw him, we
begin once more to have some imaginative sense of what it meant when
the first man rode him. In such a dream he may seem ugly, but he does
not seem unimpressive; and certainly that two-legged dwarf who could
get on top of him will not seem unimpressive. By a longer and more
erratic road we shall come back to the same marvel of the man and the
horse; and the marvel will be, if possible, even more marvellous. We
shall have again a glimpse of St. George; the more glorious because St.
George is not riding on the horse, but rather riding on the dragon.

In this example, which I have taken merely because it is an example, it
will be noted that I do not say that the nightmare seen by the first
man of the forest is either more true or more wonderful than the normal
mare of the stable seen by the civilised person who can appreciate
what is normal. Of the two extremes, I think on the whole that the
traditional grasp of truth is the better. But I say that the truth
is found at one or other of these two extremes, and is lost in the
intermediate condition of mere fatigue and forgetfulness of tradition.
In other words, I say it is better to see a horse as a monster than to
see it only as a slow substitute for a motor-car. If we have got into
that state of mind about a horse as something stale, it is far better
to be frightened of a horse because it is a good deal too fresh.

Now, as it is with the monster that is called a horse, so it is with
the monster that is called a man. Of course the best condition of all,
in my opinion, is always to have regarded man as he is regarded in
my philosophy. He who holds the Christian and Catholic view of human
nature will feel certain that it is a universal and therefore a sane
view, and will be satisfied.

But if he has lost the sane vision, he can only get it back by
something very like a mad vision; that is, by seeing man as a strange
animal and realising how strange an animal he is. But just as seeing
the horse as a prehistoric prodigy ultimately led back to, and not away
from, an admiration for the mastery of man, so the really detached
consideration of the curious career of man will lead back to, and not
away from, the ancient faith in the dark designs of God. In other
words, it is exactly when we do see how queer the quadruped is that we
praise the man who mounts him; and exactly when we do see how queer
the biped is that we praise the Providence that made him. In short,
it is the purpose of this introduction to maintain this thesis: that
it is exactly when we do regard man as an animal that we know he is
not an animal. It is precisely when we do try to picture him as a sort
of horse on its hind legs, that we suddenly realise that he must be
something as miraculous as the winged horse that towered up into the
clouds of heaven. All roads lead to Rome, all ways lead round again
to the central and civilised philosophy, including this road through
elf-land and topsyturvydom.

But it may be that it is better never to have left the land of the
reasonable tradition, where men ride lightly upon horses and are
mighty hunters before the Lord. So also in the specially Christian
case we have to react against the heavy bias of fatigue. It is almost
impossible to make the facts vivid, because the facts are familiar;
and for fallen men it is often true that familiarity is fatigue. I am
convinced that if we could tell the supernatural story of Christ word
for word as of a Chinese hero, call him the Son of Heaven instead of
the Son of God, and trace his rayed nimbus in the gold tread of Chinese
embroideries or the gold lacquer of Chinese pottery, instead of in the
gold leaf of our own old Catholic paintings, there would be a unanimous
testimony to the spiritual purity of the story.

We should hear nothing then of the injustice of substitution or the
illogicality of atonement, of the superstitious exaggeration of the
burden of sin or the impossible insolence of an invasion of the laws
of nature. We should admire the chivalry of the Chinese conception of
a god who fell from the sky to fight the dragons and save the wicked
from being devoured by their own fault and folly. We should admire
the subtlety of the Chinese view of life, which perceives that all
human imperfection is in very truth a crying imperfection. We should
admire the Chinese esoteric and superior wisdom, which said there are
higher cosmic laws than the laws we know; we believe every common
Indian conjurer who chooses to come to us and talk in the same style.
If Christianity were only a new oriental fashion, it would never be
reproached with being an old and oriental faith. I do not propose in
this book to follow the alleged example of St. Francis Xavier with
the opposite imaginative intention, and turn the Twelve Apostles into
Mandarins; not so much to make them look like natives as to make them
look like foreigners. I do not propose to work what I believe would
be a completely successful practical joke; that of telling the whole
story of the Gospel and the whole history of the church in a setting of
pagodas and pigtails; and noting with malignant humour how much it was
admired as a heathen story, in the very quarters where it is condemned
as a Christian story.

But I do propose to strike wherever possible this note of what is new
and strange, and for that reason the style even on so serious a subject
may sometimes be deliberately grotesque and fanciful.

I do desire to help the reader to see Christendom from the outside in
the sense of seeing it as a whole, against the background of other
historic things; just as I desire him to see humanity as a whole
against the background of natural things. And I say that in both
cases, when seen thus, they stand out from their background like
supernatural things. They do not fade into the rest with the colours
of impressionism; they stand out from the rest with the colours of
heraldry; as vivid as a red cross on a white shield or a black lion on
a ground of gold. So stands the Red Clay against the green field of
nature, or the White Christ against the red clay of his race.

But in order to see them clearly we have to see them as a whole. We
have to see how they developed as well as how they began; for the most
incredible part of the story is that things which began thus should
have developed thus. Anyone who chooses to indulge in mere imagination
can imagine that other things might have happened or other entities
evolved. Anyone thinking of what might have happened may conceive a
sort of evolutionary equality; but anyone facing what did happen must
face an exception and a prodigy. If there was ever a moment when man
was only an animal, we can if we choose make a fancy picture of his
career transferred to some other animal. An entertaining fantasia
might be made in which elephants built in elephantine architecture,
with towers and turrets like tusks and trunks, cities beyond the
scale of any colossus. A pleasant fable might be conceived in which
a cow had developed a costume, and put on four boots and two pairs
of trousers. We could imagine a Supermonkey more marvellous than any
Superman, a quadrumanous creature carving and painting with his hands
and cooking and carpentering with his feet. But if we are considering
what did happen, we shall certainly decide that man has distanced
everything else with a distance like that of the astronomical spaces
and a speed like that of the still thunderbolt of the light. And in the
same fashion, while we can if we choose see the Church amid a mob of
Mithraic or Manichean superstitions squabbling and killing each other
at the end of the Empire, while we can if we choose imagine the Church
killed in the struggle and some other chance cult taking its place,
we shall be the more surprised (and possibly puzzled) if we meet it
two thousand years afterwards rushing through the ages as the winged
thunderbolt of thought and everlasting enthusiasm; a thing without
rival or resemblance; and still as new as it is old.

THE MAN IN THE CAVE

Far away in some strange constellation in skies infinitely remote,
there is a small star, which astronomers may some day discover.
At least I could never observe in the faces or demeanour of most
astronomers or men of science any evidence that they have discovered
it; though as a matter of fact they were walking about on it all the
time. It is a star that brings forth out of itself very strange plants
and very strange animals; and none stranger than the men of science.
That at least is the way in which I should begin a history of the
world, if I had to follow the scientific custom of beginning with an
account of the astronomical universe. I should try to see even this
earth from the outside, not by the hackneyed insistence of its relative
position to the sun, but by some imaginative effort to conceive its
remote position for the dehumanised spectator. Only I do not believe
in being dehumanised in order to study humanity. I do not believe in
dwelling upon the distances that are supposed to dwarf the world; I
think there is even something a trifle vulgar about this idea of trying
to rebuke spirit by size. And as the first idea is not feasible, that
of making the earth a strange planet so as to make it significant, I
will not stoop to the other trick of making it a small planet in order
to make it insignificant. I would rather insist that we do not even
know that it is a planet at all, in the sense in which we know that it
is a place; and a very extraordinary place too. That is the note which
I wish to strike from the first, if not in the astronomical, then in
some more familiar fashion.

One of my first journalistic adventures, or misadventures, concerned
a comment on Grant Allen, who had written a book about the Evolution
of the Idea of God. I happened to remark that it would be much more
interesting if God wrote a book about the evolution of the idea of
Grant Allen. And I remember that the editor objected to my remark on
the ground that it was blasphemous; which naturally amused me not a
little. For the joke of it was, of course, that it never occurred
to him to notice the title of the book itself, which really was
blasphemous; for it was, when translated into English, 'I will show
you how this nonsensical notion that there is God grew up among men.'
My remark was strictly pious and proper confessing the divine purpose
even in its most seemingly dark or meaningless manifestations. In that
hour I learned many things, including the fact that there is something
purely acoustic in much of that agnostic sort of reverence. The editor
had not seen the point, because in the title of the book the long word
came at the beginning and the short word at the end; whereas in my
comments the short word came at the beginning and gave him a sort of
shock. I have noticed that if you put a word like God into the same
sentence with a word like dog, these abrupt and angular words affect
people like pistol-shots. Whether you say that God made the dog or the
dog made God does not seem to matter; that is only one of the sterile
disputations of the too subtle theologians. But so long as you begin
with a long word like evolution the rest will roll harmlessly past;
very probably the editor had not read the whole of the title, for it is
rather a long title and he was rather a busy man.

But this little incident has always lingered in my mind as a sort
of parable. Most modern histories of mankind begin with the word
evolution, and with a rather wordy exposition of evolution, for much
the same reason that operated in this case. There is something slow
and soothing and gradual about the word and even about the idea. As
a matter of fact, it is not, touching these primary things, a very
practical word or a very profitable idea. Nobody can imagine how
nothing could turn into something. Nobody can get an inch nearer to
it by explaining how something could turn into something else. It
is really far more logical to start by saying 'In the beginning God
created heaven and earth' even if you only mean 'In the beginning
some unthinkable power began some unthinkable process.' For God is by
its nature a name of mystery, and nobody ever supposed that man could
imagine how a world was created any more than he could create one. But
evolution really is mistaken for explanation. It has the fatal quality
of leaving on many minds the impression that they do understand it and
everything else; just as many of them live under a sort of illusion
that they have read the Origin of Species.

But this notion of something smooth and slow, like the ascent of a
slope, is a great part of the illusion. It is an illogicality as
well as an illusion; for slowness has really nothing to do with
the question. An event is not any more intrinsically intelligible
or unintelligible because of the pace at which it moves. For a man
who does not believe in a miracle, a slow miracle would be just as
incredible as a swift one. The Greek witch may have turned sailors to
swine with a stroke of the wand. But to see a naval gentleman of our
acquaintance looking a little more like a pig every day, till he ended
with four trotters and a curly tail, would not be any more soothing.
It might be rather more creepy and uncanny. The medieval wizard may
have flown through the air from the top of a tower; but to see an
old gentleman walking through the air, in a leisurely and lounging
manner, would still seem to call for some explanation. Yet there runs
through all the rationalistic treatment of history this curious and
confused idea that difficulty is avoided, or even mystery eliminated,
by dwelling on mere delay or on something dilatory in the processes of
things. There will be something to be said upon particular examples
elsewhere; the question here is the false atmosphere of facility and
ease given by the mere suggestion of going slow; the sort of comfort
that might be given to a nervous old woman travelling for the first
time in a motor-car.

Mr. H. G. Wells has confessed to being a prophet; and in this matter
he was a prophet at his own expense. It is curious that his first
fairy-tale was a complete answer to his last book of history. The Time
Machine destroyed in advance all comfortable conclusions founded on the
mere relativity of time. In that sublime nightmare the hero saw trees
shoot up like green rockets, and vegetation spread visibly like a green
conflagration, or the sun shoot across the sky from east to west with
the swiftness of a meteor. Yet in his sense these things were quite
as natural when they went swiftly; and in our sense they are quite as
supernatural when they go slowly. The ultimate question is why they go
at all; and anybody who really understands that question will know that
it always has been and always will be a religious question; or at any
rate a philosophical or metaphysical question. And most certainly he
will not think the question answered by some substitution of gradual
for abrupt change; or, in other words by a merely relative question of
the same story being spun out or rattled rapidly through, as can be
done with any story at a cinema by turning a handle.

Now what is needed for these problems of primitive existence is
something more like a primitive spirit. In calling up this vision of
the first things, I would ask the reader to make with me a sort of
experiment in simplicity. And by simplicity I do not mean stupidity,
but rather the sort of clarity that sees things like life rather than
words like evolution. For this purpose it would really be better to
turn the handle of the Time Machine a little more quickly and see
the grass growing and the trees springing up into the sky, if that
experiment could contract and concentrate and make vivid the upshot of
the whole affair. What we know, in a sense in which we know nothing
else, is that the trees and the grass did grow and that number of
other extraordinary things do in fact happen; that queer creatures
support themselves in the empty air by beating it with fans of various
fantastic shapes; that other queer creatures steer themselves about
alive under a load of mighty waters; that other queer creatures walk
about on four legs, and that the queerest creature of all walks about
on two. These are things and not theories; and compared with them
evolution and the atom and even the solar system are merely theories.
The matter here is one of history and not of philosophy so that it need
only be noted that no philosopher denies that a mystery still attaches
to the two great transitions: the origin of the universe itself and
the origin of the principle of life itself. Most philosophers have
the enlightenment to add that a third mystery attaches to the origin
of man himself. In other words, a third bridge was built across a
third abyss of the unthinkable when there came into the world what
we call reason and what we call will. Man is not merely an evolution
but rather a revolution. That he has a backbone or other parts upon a
similar pattern to birds and fishes is an obvious fact, whatever be the
meaning of the fact. But if we attempt to regard him, as it were, as
a quadruped standing on his hind legs, we shall find what follows far
more fantastic and subversive than if he were standing on his head.

I will take one example to serve for an introduction to the story of
man. It illustrates what I mean by saying that a certain childish
directness is needed to see the truth about the childhood of the world.
It illustrates what I mean by saying that a mixture of popular science
and journalistic jargon have confused the facts about the first things,
so that we cannot see which of them really comes first. It illustrates,
though only in one convenient illustration, all that I mean by the
necessity of seeing the sharp differences that give its shape to
history, instead of being submerged in all these generalisations about
slowness and sameness. For we do indeed require, in Mr. Wells's phrase,
an outline of history. But we may venture to say, in Mr. Mantalini's
phrase, that this evolutionary history has no outline or is a demd
outline. But, above all, it illustrates what I mean by saying that the
more we really look at man as an animal, the less he will look like one.

To-day all our novels and newspapers will be found swarming with
numberless allusions to a popular character called a Cave-Man. He
seems to be quite familiar to us, not only as a public character but
as a private character. His psychology is seriously taken into account
in psychological fiction and psychological medicine. So far as I can
understand, his chief occupation in life was knocking his wife about,
or treating women in general with what is, I believe, known in the
world of the film as 'rough stuff.' I have never happened to come upon
the evidence for this idea; and I do not know on what primitive diaries
or prehistoric divorce-reports it is founded. Nor, as I have explained
elsewhere, have I ever been able to see the probability of it, even
considered a priori. We are always told without any explanation or
authority that primitive man waved a club and knocked the woman down
before he carried her off. But on every animal analogy, it would seem
an almost morbid modesty and reluctance, on the part of the lady,
always to insist on being knocked down before consenting to be carried
off. And I repeat that I can never comprehend why, when the male was so
very rude, the female should have been so very refined. The cave-man
may have been a brute, but there is no reason why he should have been
more brutal than the brutes. And the loves of the giraffes and the
river romance of the hippopotami are effected without any of this
preliminary fracas or shindy. The cave-man may have been no better that
the cave-bear; but the child she-bear, so famous in hymnology, is not
trained with any such bias for spinsterhood. In short these details of
the domestic life of the cave puzzle me upon either the revolutionary
or the static hypothesis; and in any case I should like to look into
the evidence for them, but unfortunately I have never been able to find
it. But the curious thing is this: that while ten thousand tongues of
more or less scientific or literary gossip seemed to be talking at once
about this unfortunate fellow, under the title of the cave-man, the one
connection in which it is really relevant and sensible to talk about
him as the cave-man has been comparatively neglected. People have used
this loose term in twenty loose ways, but they have never even looked
at their own term for what could really be learned from it.

In fact, people have been interested in everything about the cave-man
except what he did in the cave. Now there does happen to be some real
evidence of what he did in the cave. It is little enough, like all
the prehistoric evidence, but it is concerned with the real cave-man
and his cave and not the literary cave-man and his club. And it will
be valuable to our sense of reality to consider quite simply what
that real evidence is, and not to go beyond it. What was found in the
cave was not the club, the horrible gory club notched with the number
of women it had knocked on the head. The cave was not a Bluebeard's
Chamber filled with the skeletons of slaughtered wives; it was not
filled with female skulls all arranged in rows and all cracked like
eggs. It was something quite unconnected, one way or the other, with
all the modern phrases and philosophical implications and literary
rumours which confuse the whole question for us. And if we wish to see
as it really is this authentic glimpse of the morning of the world, it
will be far better to conceive even the story of its discovery as some
such legend of the land of morning. It would be far better to tell the
tale of what was really found as simply as the tale of heroes finding
the Golden Fleece or the Gardens of the Hesperides, if we could so
escape from a fog of controversial theories into the clear colours and
clean-cut outlines of such a dawn. The old epic poets at least knew how
to tell a story, possibly a tall story but never a twisted story, never
a story tortured out of its own shape to fit theories and philosophies
invented centuries afterwards. It would be well if modern investigators
could describe their discoveries in the bald narrative style of the
earliest travellers, and without any of these long allusive words
that are full of irrelevant implication and suggestion. Then we might
realise exactly what we do know about the cave-man, or at any rate
about the cave.

A priest and a boy entered sometime ago a hollow in the hills and
passed into a sort of subterranean tunnel that led into a labyrinth
of such sealed and secret corridors of rock. They crawled through
cracks that seemed almost impassable, they crept through tunnels that
might have been made for moles, they dropped into holes as hopeless
as wells, they seemed to be burying themselves alive seven times over
beyond the hope of resurrection. This is but the commonplace of all
such courageous exploration; but what is needed here is some one who
shall put such stories in the primary light, in which they are not
commonplace. There is, for instance, something strangely symbolic in
the accident that the first intruders into that sunken world were
a priest and a boy, the types of the antiquity and of youth of the
world. But here I am even more concerned with the symbolism of the
boy than with that of the priest. Nobody who remembers boyhood needs
to be told what it might be to a boy to enter like Peter Pan under
a roof of the roots of all the trees and go deeper and deeper, till
he reach what William Morris called the very roots of the mountains.
Suppose somebody, with that simple and unspoilt realism that is a part
of innocence, to pursue that journey to its end, not for the sake of
what he could deduce or demonstrate in some dusty magazine controversy,
but simply for the sake of what he could see. What he did see at last
was a cavern so far from the light of day that it might have been
the legendary Domdaniel cavern, that was under the floor of the sea.
This secret chamber of rock, when illuminated after its long night of
unnumbered ages, revealed on its walls large and sprawling outlines
diversified with coloured earths; and when they followed the lines of
them they recognised, across that vast and void of ages, the movement
and the gesture of a man's hand. They were drawings or paintings of
animals; and they were drawn or painted not only by a man but by an
artist. Under whatever archaic limitations, they showed that love of
the long sweeping or the long wavering line which any man who has ever
drawn or tried to draw will recognise; and about which no artist will
allow himself to be contradicted by any scientist. They showed the
experimental and adventurous spirit of the artist, the spirit that does
not avoid but attempt difficult things; as where the draughtsman had
represented the action of the stag when he swings his head clean round
and noses towards his tail, an action familiar enough in the horse.
But there are many modern animal-painters who would set themselves
something of a task in rendering it truly. In this and twenty other
details it is clear that the artist had watched animals with a certain
interest and presumably a certain pleasure. In that sense it would seem
that he was not only an artist but a naturalist; the sort of naturalist
who is really natural.

Now it is needless to note, except in passing, that there is nothing
whatever in the atmosphere of that cave to suggest the bleak and
pessimistic atmosphere of that journalistic cave of the winds, that
blows and bellows about us with countless echoes concerning the
cave-man. So far as any human character can be hinted at by such traces
of the past, that human character is quite human and even humane. It is
certainly not the ideal of an inhuman character, like the abstraction
invoked in popular science. When novelists and educationists and
psychologists of all sorts talk about the cave-man, they never conceive
him in connection with anything that is really in the cave. When
the realist of the sex novel writes, 'Red sparks danced in Dagmar
Doubledick's brain; he felt the spirit of the cave-man rising within
him,' the novelist's readers would be very much disappointed if Dagmar
only went off and drew large pictures of cows on the drawing-room wall.
When the psycho-analyst writes to a patient, 'The submerged instincts
of the cave-man are doubtless prompting you to gratify a violent
impulse,' he does not refer to the impulse to paint in water-colours;
or to make conscientious studies of how cattle swing their heads when
they graze. Yet we do know for a fact that the cave man did these mild
and innocent things; and we have not the most minute speck of evidence
that he did any of the violent and ferocious things. In other words
the cave-man as commonly presented to us is simply a myth or rather
a muddle; for a myth has at least an imaginative outline of truth.
The whole of the current way of talking is simply a confusion and a
misunderstanding, founded on no sort of scientific evidence and valued
only as an excuse for a very modern mood of anarchy. If any gentleman
wants to knock a woman about, he can surely be a cad without taking
away the character of the cave-man, about whom we know next to nothing
except what we can gather from a few harmless and pleasing pictures on
a wall.

But this is not the point about the pictures or the particular moral
here to be drawn from them. That moral is something much larger and
simpler, so large and simple that when it is first stated it will sound
childish. And indeed it is in the highest sense childish; and that is
why I have in this apologue in some sense seen it through the eyes of
a child. It is the biggest of all the facts really facing the boy in
the cavern; and is perhaps too big to be seen. If the boy was one of
the flock of the priest, it may be presumed that he had been trained in
a certain quality of common sense; that common sense that often comes
to us in the form of tradition. In that case he would simply recognise
the primitive man's work as the work of a man, interesting but in no
way incredible in being primitive. He would see what was there to see;
and he would not be tempted into seeing what was not there, by any
evolutionary excitement or fashionable speculation. If he had heard
of such things he would admit, of course, that the speculations might
be true and were not incompatible with the facts that were true. The
artist may have had another side to his character besides that which
he has alone left on record in his works of art. The primitive man may
have taken a pleasure in beating women as well as in drawing animals;
all we can say is that the drawings record the one but not the other.
It may be true that when the cave-man's finished jumping on his mother,
or his wife as the case may be, he loves to hear the little brook
a-gurgling, and also to watch the deer as they come down to drink at
the brook. These things are not impossible, but they are irrelevant.
The common sense of the child could confine itself to learning from the
facts what the facts have to teach; and the pictures in the cave are
very nearly all the facts there are. So far as that evidence goes, the
child would be justified in assuming that a man had represented animals
with rock and red ochre for the same reason as he himself was in the
habit of trying to represent animals with charcoal and red chalk. The
man had drawn a stag just as the child had drawn a horse; because it
was fun. The man had drawn a stag with his head turned as the child had
drawn a pig with his eyes shut; because it was difficult. The child and
the man, being both human, would be united by the brotherhood of men;
and the brotherhood of men is even nobler when it bridges the abyss of
ages than when it bridges only the chasm of class. But anyhow he would
see no evidence of the cave man of crude evolutionism; because there is
none to be seen. If somebody told him that the pictures had all been
drawn by St. Francis of Assisi out of pure and saintly love of animals,
there would be nothing in the cave to contradict it.

Indeed I once knew a lady who half-humorously suggested that the cave
was a creche, in which the babies were put to be specially safe, and
that coloured animals were drawn on the walls to amuse them; very much
as diagrams of elephants and giraffes adorn a modern infant school. And
though this was but a jest, it does draw attention to some of the other
assumptions that we make only too readily. The pictures do not prove
even that the cave-men lived in caves, any more than the discovery of
a wine-cellar in Balham (long after that suburb had been destroyed by
human or divine wrath) would prove that the Victorian middle classes
lived entirely underground. The cave might have had a special purpose
like the cellar; it might have been a religious shrine or a refuge in
war or the meeting place of a secret society or all sorts of things.
But it is quite true that its artistic decoration has much more of the
atmosphere of a nursery than of any of these nightmares of anarchical
fury and fear. I have conceived a child as standing in the cave; and it
is easy to conceive any child, modern or immeasurably remote, as making
a living gesture as if to pat the painted beasts upon the wall. In that
gesture there is a foreshadowing, as we shall see later, of another
cavern and another child.

But suppose the boy had not been taught by a priest but by a professor,
by one of the professors who simplify the relation of men and beasts
to a mere evolutionary variation. Suppose the boy saw himself, with
the same simplicity and sincerity, as a mere Mowgli running with the
pack of nature and roughly indistinguishable from the rest save by
a relative and recent variation. What would be for him the simplest
lesson of that strange stone picture-book? After all, it would come
back to this; that he had dug very deep and found the place where a
man had drawn the picture of a reindeer. But he would dig a good deal
deeper before he found a place where a reindeer had drawn a picture of
a man. That sounds like a truism, but in this connection it is really a
very tremendous truth. He might descend to depths unthinkable, he might
sink into sunken continents as strange as remote stars, he might find
himself in the inside of the world as far from men as the other side
of the moon; he might see in those cold chasms or colossal terraces of
stone, traced in the faint hieroglyphic of the fossil, the ruins of
lost dynasties of biological life, rather like the ruins of successive
creations and separate universes than the stages in the story of one.
He would find the trail of monsters blindly developing in directions
outside all our common imagery of fish and bird; groping and grasping
and touching life with every extravagant elongation of horn and tongue
and tentacle; growing a forest of fantastic caricatures of the claw
and the fin and the finger. But nowhere would he find one finger that
had traced one significant line upon the sand; nowhere one claw that
had even begun to scratch the faint suggestion of a form. To all
appearance, the thing would be as unthinkable in all those countless
cosmic variations of forgotten aeons as it would be in the beasts and
birds before our eyes The child would no more expect to see it than to
see the cat scratch on the wall a vindictive caricature of the dog.
The childish common sense would keep the most evolutionary child from
expecting to see anything like that; yet in the traces of the rude and
recently evolved ancestors of humanity he would have seen exactly that.
It must surely strike him as strange that men so remote from him should
be so near, and that beasts so near to him should be so remote. To his
simplicity it must seem at least odd that he could not find any trace
of the beginning of any arts among any animals. That is the simplest
lesson to learn in the cavern of the coloured pictures; only it is too
simple to be learnt. It is the simple truth that man does differ from
the brutes in kind and not in degree; and the proof of it is here;
that it sounds like a truism to say that the most primitive man drew a
picture of a monkey and that it sounds like a joke to say that the most
intelligent monkey drew a picture of a man. Something of division and
disproportion has appeared; and it is unique. Art is the signature of
man.

That is the sort of simple truth with which a story of the beginnings
ought really to begin. The evolutionist stands staring in the painted
cavern at the things that are too large to be seen and too simple to be
understood. He tries to deduce all sorts of other indirect and doubtful
things from the details of the pictures, because he can not see the
primary significance of the whole; thin and theoretical deductions
about the absence of religion or the presence of superstition; about
tribal government and hunting and human sacrifice and heaven knows
what. In the next chapter I shall try to trace in a little more detail
the much disputed question about these prehistoric origins of human
ideas and especially of the religious idea. Here I am only taking this
one case of the cave as a sort of symbol of the simpler sort of truth
with which the story ought to start. When all is said, the main fact
that the record of the reindeer men attests, along with all other
records, is that the reindeer man could draw and the reindeer could
not. If the reindeer man was as much an animal as the reindeer, it was
all the more extraordinary that he could do what all other animals
could not. If he was an ordinary product of biological growth, like any
other beast or bird, then it is all the more extraordinary that he was
not in the least like any other beast or bird. He seems rather more
supernatural as a natural product than as a supernatural one.

But I have begun this story in the cave, like the cave of the
speculations of Plato, because it is a sort of model of the mistake
of merely evolutionary introductions and prefaces. It is useless to
begin by saying that everything was slow and smooth and a mere matter
of development and degree. For in the plain matter like the pictures
there is in fact not a trace of any such development or degree. Monkeys
did not begin pictures and men finish them; Pithecanthropus did not
draw a reindeer badly and Homo Sapiens draw it well. The higher animals
did not draw better and better portraits; the dog did not paint better
in his best period than in his early bad manner as a jackal; the wild
horse was not an Impressionist and the race-horse a Post-Impressionist.
All we can say of this notion of reproducing things in shadow or
representative shape is that it exists nowhere in nature except in man;
and that we cannot even talk about it without treating man as something
separate from nature. In other words, every sane sort of history must
begin with man as man, a thing standing absolute and alone. How he
came there, or indeed how anything else came there, is a thing for
theologians and philosophers and scientists and not for historians. But
an excellent test case of this isolation and mystery is the matter of
the impulse of art. This creature was truly different from all other
creatures; because he was a creator as well as a creature. Nothing in
that sense could be made in any other image but the image of man. But
the truth is so true that, even in the absence of any religious belief,
it must be assumed in the form of some moral or metaphysical principle.
In the next chapter we shall see how this principle applies to all the
historical hypotheses and evolutionary ethics now in fashion; to the
origins of tribal government or mythological belief. But the clearest
and most convenient example to start with is this popular one of what
the cave-man really did in his cave. It means that somehow or other a
new thing had appeared in the cavernous night of nature, a mind that
is like a mirror. It is like a mirror because it is truly a thing of
reflection. It is like a mirror because in it alone all the other
shapes can be seen like shining shadows in a vision. Above all, it is
like a mirror because it is the only thing of its kind. Other things
may resemble it or resemble each other in various ways; other things
may excel it or excel each other in various ways; just as in the
furniture of a room a table may be round like a mirror or a cupboard
may be larger than a mirror. But the mirror is the only thing that
can contain them all. Man is the microcosm; man is the measure of all
things; man is the image of God These are the only real lessons to be
learnt in the cave, and it is time to leave it for the open road.

It will be well in this place, however, to sum up once and for all what
is meant by saying that man is at once the exception to everything and
the mirror and the measure of all things. But to see man as he is,
it is necessary once more to keep close to that simplicity that can
clear itself of accumulated clouds of sophistry. The simplest truth
about man is that he is a very strange being; almost in the sense of
being a stranger on the earth. In all sobriety, he has much more of
the external appearance of one bringing alien habits from another land
than of a mere growth of this one. He has an unfair advantage and an
unfair disadvantage. He cannot sleep in his own skin; he cannot trust
his own instincts. He is at once a creator moving miraculous hands and
fingers and a kind of cripple. He is wrapped in artificial bandages
called clothes; he is propped on artificial crutches called furniture.
His mind has the same doubtful liberties and the same wild limitations.
Alone among the animals, he is shaken with the beautiful madness called
laughter; as if he had caught sight of some secret in the very shape of
the universe hidden from the universe itself. Alone among the animals
he feels the need of averting his thought from the root realities of
his own bodily being; of hiding them as in the presence of some higher
possibility which creates the mystery of shame. Whether we praise these
things as natural to man or abuse them as artificial in nature, they
remain in the same sense unique. This is realised by the whole popular
instinct called religion, until disturbed by pedants, especially the
laborious pedants of the Simple Life. The most sophistical of all
sophists are gymnosophists.

It is not natural to see man as a natural product. It is not common
sense to call man a common object of the country or the seashore. It is
not seeing straight to see him as an animal. It is not sane. It sins
against the light; against that broad daylight of proportion which is
the principle of all reality. It is reached by stretching a point,
by making out a case, by artificially selecting a certain light and
shade, by bringing into prominence the lesser or lower things which may
happen to be similar. The solid thing standing in the sunlight, the
thing we can walk round and see from all sides, is quite different. It
is also quite extraordinary, and the more sides we see of it the more
extraordinary it seems. It is emphatically not a thing that follows
or flows naturally from anything else. If we imagine that an inhuman
or impersonal intelligence could have felt from the first the general
nature of the non-human world sufficiently to see that things would
evolve in whatever way they did evolve, there would have been nothing
whatever in all that natural world to prepare such a mind for such an
unnatural novelty. To such a mind, man would most certainly not have
seemed something like one herd out of a hundred herds finding richer
pasture, or one swallow out of a hundred swallows making a summer under
a strange sky. It would not be in the same scale and scarcely in the
same dimension. We might as truly say that it would not be in the same
universe. It would be more like seeing one cow out of a hundred cows
suddenly jump over the moon or one pig out of a hundred pigs grow wings
in a flash and fly. It would not be a question of the cattle finding
their own grazing ground but of their building their own cattle-sheds,
not a question of one swallow making a summer but of his making a
summer house. For the very fact that birds do build nests is one of
those similarities that sharpen the startling difference. The very
fact that a bird can get as far as building a nest, and cannot get any
farther, proves that he has not a mind as man has a mind; it proves it
more completely than if he built nothing at all. If he built nothing at
all, he might possibly be a philosopher of the Quietist or Buddhistic
school, indifferent to all but the mind within. But when he builds
as he does build and is satisfied and sings aloud with satisfaction,
then we know there is really an invisible veil like a pane of glass
between him and us, like the window on which a bird will beat in vain.
But suppose our abstract onlooker saw one of the birds begin to build
as men build. Suppose in an incredibly short space of time there were
seven styles of architecture for one style of nest. Suppose the bird
carefully selected forked twigs and pointed leaves to express the
piercing piety of Gothic, but turned to broad foliage and black mud
when he sought in a darker mood to call up the heavy columns of Bel
and Ashtaroth; making his nest indeed one of the hanging gardens of
Babylon. Suppose the bird made little clay statues of birds celebrated
in letters or politics and stuck them up in front of the nest. Suppose
that one bird out of a thousand birds began to do one of the thousand
things that man had already done even in the morning of the world; and
we can be quite certain that the onlooker would not regard such a bird
as a mere evolutionary variety of the other birds; he would regard it
as a very fearful wild-fowl indeed; possibly as a bird of ill-omen,
certainly as an omen. That bird would tell the augurs, not of something
that would happen, but of some thing that had happened. That something
would be the appearance of a mind with a new dimension of depth; a mind
like that of man. If there be no God, no other mind could conceivably
have foreseen it.

Now, as a matter of fact, there is not a shadow of evidence that this
thing was evolved at all. There is not a particle of roof that this
transition came slowly, or even that it came naturally. In a strictly
scientific sense, we simply know nothing whatever about how it grew, or
whether it grew, or what it is. There may be a broken trail of stone
and bone faintly suggesting the development of the human body. There
is nothing even faintly suggesting such a development of this human
mind. It was not and it was; we know not in what instant or in what
infinity of years. Something happened; and it has all the appearance
of a transaction outside of time. It has therefore nothing to do
with history in the ordinary sense. The historian must take it or
something like it for granted; it is not his business as a historian
to explain it. But if he cannot explain it as a historian, he will
not explain it as a biologist. In neither case is there any disgrace
to him in accepting it without explaining it; for it is a reality,
and history and biology deal with realities. He is quite justified in
calmly confronting the pig with wings and the cow that jumped over
the moon, merely because they have happened. He can reasonably accept
man as a freak, because he accepts man as a fact. He can be perfectly
comfortable in a crazy and disconnected world, or in a world that can
produce such a crazy and disconnected thing. For reality is a thing in
which we can all repose, even if it hardly seems related to anything
else. The thing is there; and that is enough for most of us. But if we
do indeed want to know how it can conceivably have come there, if we do
indeed wish to see it related realistically to other things, if we do
insist on seeing it evolved before our very eyes from an environment
nearer to its own nature, then assuredly it is to very different things
that we must go. We must stir very strange memories and return to very
simple dreams, if we desire some origin that can make man other than
a monster. We shall have discovered very different causes before he
becomes a creature of causation; and invoked other authority to turn
him into something reasonable, or even into anything probable. That
way lies all that is at once awful and familiar and forgotten, with
dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms. We can accept man as a fact,
if we are content with an unexplained fact. We can accept him as an
animal, if we can live with a fabulous animal. But if we must needs
have sequence and necessity, then indeed we must provide a prelude
and crescendo of mounting miracles, that ushered in with unthinkable
thunders in all the seven heavens of another order, a man may be an
ordinary thing.

PROFESSORS AND PREHISTORIC MEN

Science is weak about these prehistoric things in a way that has hardly
been noticed. The science whose modern marvels we all admire succeeds
by incessantly adding to its data. In all practical inventions, in most
natural discoveries, it can always increase evidence by experiment.
But it cannot experiment in making men; or even in watching to see
what the first men make. An inventor can advance step by step in the
construction of an aeroplane, even if he is only experimenting with
sticks and scraps of metal in his own back-yard. But he cannot watch
the Missing Link evolving in his own back-yard. If he has made a
mistake in his calculations, the aeroplane will correct it by crashing
to the ground. But if he has made a mistake about the arboreal habitat
of his ancestor, he cannot see his arboreal ancestor falling off the
tree. He cannot keep a cave-man like a cat in the back-yard and watch
him to see whether he does really practice cannibalism or carry off his
mate on the principles of marriage by capture. He cannot keep a tribe
of primitive men like a pack of hounds and notice how far they are
influenced by the herd instinct. If he sees a particular bird behave
in a particular way, he can get other birds and see if they behave in
that way; but if he finds a skull, or the scrap of a skull, in the
hollow of a hill, he cannot multiply it into a vision of the valley of
dry bones. In dealing with a past that has almost entirely perished,
he can only go by evidence and not by experiment. And there is hardly
enough evidence to be even evidential. Thus while most science moves
in a sort of curve, being constantly corrected by new evidence,
this science flies off into space in a straight line uncorrected by
anything. But the habit of forming conclusions, as they can really be
formed in more fruitful fields, is so fixed in the scientific mind that
it cannot resist talking like this. It talks about the idea suggested
by one scrap of bone as if it were something like the aeroplane which
is constructed at last out of whole scrapheaps of scraps of metal. The
trouble with the professor of the prehistoric is that he cannot scrap
his scrap. The marvellous and triumphant aeroplane is made out of a
hundred mistakes. The student of origins can only make one mistake and
stick to it.

We talk very truly of the patience of science; but in this department
it would be truer to talk of the impatience of science. Owing to the
difficulty above described, the theorist is in far too much of a hurry.
We have a series of hypotheses so hasty that they may well be called
fancies, and cannot in any case be further corrected by facts. The most
empirical anthropologist is here as limited as an antiquary. He can
only cling to a fragment of the past and has no way of increasing it
for the future He can only clutch his fragment of fact, almost as the
primitive man clutched his fragment of flint. And indeed he does deal
with it in much the same way and for much the same reason. It is his
tool and his only tool. It is his weapon and his only weapon. He often
wields it with a fanaticism far in excess of anything shown by men of
science when they can collect more facts from experience and even add
new facts by experiment. Sometimes the professor with his bone becomes
almost as dangerous as a dog with his bone. And the dog at least does
not deduce a theory from it, proving that mankind is going to the
dogs--or that it came from them.

For instance, I have pointed out the difficulty of keeping a monkey
and watching it evolve into a man. Experimental evidence of such an
evolution being impossible, the professor is not content to say (as
most of us would be ready to say) that such an evolution is likely
enough anyhow. He produces his little bone, or little collection of
bones, and deduces the most marvellous things from it. He found in
Java a piece of a skull, seeming by its contour to be smaller than the
human. Somewhere near it he found an upright thigh-bone and in the same
scattered fashion some teeth that were not human. If they all form part
of one creature, which is doubtful, our conception of the creature
would be almost equally doubtful. But the effect on popular science
was to produce a complete and even complex figure, finished down to
the last details of hair and habits. He was given a name as if he were
an ordinary historical character. People talked of Pithecanthropus as
of Pitt or Fox or Napoleon. Popular histories published portraits of
him like the portraits of Charles the First and George the Fourth. A
detailed drawing was reproduced, carefully shaded, to show that the
very hairs of his head were all numbered No uninformed person looking
at its carefully lined face and wistful eyes would imagine for a moment
that this was the portrait of a thigh-bone; or of a few teeth and a
fragment of a cranium. In the same way people talked about him as if
he were an individual whose influence and character were familiar to
us all. I have just read a story in a magazine about Java, and how
modern white inhabitants of that island are prevailed on to misbehave
themselves by the personal influence of poor old Pithecanthropus. That
the modern inhabitants of Java misbehave themselves I can very readily
believe; but I do not imagine that they need any encouragement from
the discovery of a few highly doubtful bones. Anyhow, those bones are
far too few and fragmentary and dubious to fill up the whole of the
vast void that does in reason and in reality lie between man and his
bestial ancestors, if they were his ancestors. On the assumption of
that evolutionary connection (a connection which I am not in the least
concerned to deny), the really arresting and remarkable fact is the
comparative absence of any such remains recording that connection at
that point. The sincerity of Darwin really admitted this; and that is
how we came to use such a term as the Missing Link. But the dogmatism
of Darwinians has been too strong for the agnosticism of Darwin;
and men have insensibly fallen into turning this entirely negative
term into a positive image. They talk of searching for the habits
and habitat of the Missing Link; as if one were to talk of being on
friendly terms with the gap in a narrative or the hole in an argument,
of taking a walk with a non-sequitur or dining with an undistributed
middle.

In this sketch, therefore, of man in his relation to certain religious
and historical problems, I shall waste no further space on these
speculations on the nature of man before he became man. His body may
have been evolved from the brutes; but we know nothing of any such
transition that throws the smallest light upon his soul as it has shown
itself in history. Unfortunately the same school of writers pursue the
same style of reasoning when they come to the first real evidence about
the first real men. Strictly speaking of course we know nothing about
prehistoric man, for the simple reason that he was prehistoric. The
history of prehistoric man is a very obvious contradiction in terms.
It is the sort of unreason in which only rationalists are allowed
to indulge. If a parson had casually observed that the Flood was
ante-diluvian, it is possible that he might be a little chaffed about
his logic. If a bishop were to say that Adam was Preadamite, we might
think it a little odd. But we are not supposed to notice such verbal
trifles when sceptical historians talk of the part of history that is
prehistoric. The truth is that they are using the terms historic and
prehistoric without any clear test or definition in their minds. What
they mean is that there are traces of human lives before the beginning
of human stories; and in that sense we do at least know that humanity
was before history.

Human civilisation is older than human records. That is the sane way
of stating our relations to these remote things. Humanity has left
examples of its other arts earlier than the art of writing; or at
least of any writing that we can read. But it is certain that the
primitive arts were arts; and it is in every way probable that the
primitive civilisations were civilisations. The man left a picture
of the reindeer, but he did not leave a narrative of how he hunted
the reindeer; and therefore what we say of him is hypothesis and not
history. But the art he did practice was quite artistic; his drawing
was quite intelligent and there is no reason to doubt that his story
of the hunt would be quite intelligent, only if it exists it is not
intelligible. In short, the prehistoric period need not mean the
primitive period, in the sense of the barbaric or bestial period. It
does not mean the time before civilisation or the time before arts and
crafts. It simply means the time before any connected narratives that
we can read. This does indeed make all the practical difference between
remembrance and forgetfulness; but it is perfectly possible that there
were all sorts of forgotten forms of civilisation, as well as all sorts
of forgotten forms of barbarism. And in any case everything indicated
that many of these forgotten or half-forgotten social stages were much
more civilised and much less barbaric than is vulgarly imagined today.
But even about these unwritten histories of humanity, when humanity was
quite certainly human, we can only conjecture with the greatest doubt
and caution. And unfortunately doubt and caution are the last things
commonly encouraged by the loose evolutionism of current culture. For
that culture is full of curiosity; and the one thing that it cannot
endure is the agony of agnosticism. It was in the Darwinian age that
the word first became known and the thing first became impossible.

It is necessary to say plainly that all this ignorance is simply
covered by impudence. Statements are made so plainly and positively
that men have hardly the moral courage to pause upon them and find that
they are without support. The other day a scientific summary of the
state of a prehistoric tribe began confidently with the words 'They
wore no clothes.' Not one reader in a hundred probably stopped to ask
himself how we should come to know whether clothes had once been worn
by people of whom everything has perished except a few chips of bone
and stone. It was doubtless hoped that we should find a stone hat as
well as a stone hatchet. It was evidently anticipated that we might
discover an everlasting pair of trousers of the same substance as the
everlasting rock. But to persons of a less sanguine temperament it
will be immediately apparent that people might wear simple garments,
or even highly ornamental garments, without leaving any more traces of
them than these people have left. The plaiting of rushes and grasses,
for instance, might have become more and more elaborate without in
the least becoming more eternal. One civilisation might specialise in
things that happened to be perishable, like weaving and embroidery,
and not in things that happen to be more permanent, like architecture
and sculpture. There have been plenty of examples of such specialist
societies. A man of the future finding the ruins of our factory
machinery might as fairly say that we were acquainted with iron and
with no other substance; and announce the discovery that the proprietor
and manager of the factory undoubtedly walked about naked--or possibly
wore iron hats and trousers.

It is not contended here that these primitive men did wear clothes any
more than they did weave rushes; but merely that we have not enough
evidence to know whether they did or not. But it may be worthwhile
to look back for a moment at some of the very few things that we do
know and that they did do. If we consider them, we shall certainly not
find them inconsistent with such ideas as dress and decoration. We do
not know whether they decorated other things. We do not know whether
they had embroideries, and if they had the embroideries could not be
expected to have remained. But we do know that they did have pictures;
and the pictures have remained. And there remains with them, as already
suggested, the testimony to something that is absolute and unique; that
belongs to man and to nothing else except man; that is a difference of
kind and not a difference of degree. A monkey does not draw clumsily
and a man cleverly; a monkey does not begin the art of representation
and a man carry it to perfection. A monkey does not do it at all; he
does not begin to do it at all; he does not begin to begin to do it at
all. A line of some kind is crossed before the first faint line can
begin.

Another distinguished writer, again, in commenting on the cave drawings
attributed to the neolithic men of the reindeer period, said that
none of their pictures appeared to have any religious purpose; and he
seemed almost to infer that they had no religion. I can hardly imagine
a thinner thread of argument than this which reconstructs the very
inmost moods of the pre-historic mind from the fact that somebody
who has scrawled a few sketches on a rock, from what motive we do
not know, for what purpose we do not know, acting under what customs
or conventions we do not know, may possibly have found it easier to
draw reindeer than to draw religion. He may have drawn it because it
was his religious symbol. He may have drawn it because it was not his
religious symbol. He may have drawn anything except his religious
symbol. He may have drawn his real religious symbol somewhere else;
or it may have been deliberately destroyed when it was drawn. He may
have done or not done half a million things; but in any case it is
an amazing leap of logic to infer that he had no religious symbol,
or even to infer from his having no religious symbol that he had no
religion. Now this particular case happens to illustrate the insecurity
of these guesses very clearly. For a little while afterwards, people
discovered not only paintings but sculptures of animals in the caves.
Some of these were said to be damaged with dints or holes supposed to
be the marks of arrows; and the damaged images were conjectured to be
the remains of some magic rite of killing the beasts in effigy; while
the undamaged images were explained in connection with another magic
rite invoking fertility upon the herds. Here again there is something
faintly humorous about the scientific habit of having it both ways. If
the image is damaged it proves one superstition and if it is undamaged
it proves another. Here again there is a rather reckless jumping to
conclusions; it has hardly occurred to the speculators that a crowd
of hunters imprisoned in winter in a cave might conceivably have
aimed at a mark for fun, as a sort of primitive parlour game. But in
any case, if it was done out of superstition, what has become of the
thesis that it had nothing to do with religion? The truth is that all
this guess work has nothing to do with anything. It is not half such a
good parlour game as shooting arrows at a carved reindeer, for it is
shooting them into the air.

Such speculators rather tend to forget, for instance, that men in
the modern world also sometimes make marks in caves. When a crowd of
trippers is conducted through the labyrinth of the Marvelous Grotto or
the Magic Stalactite Cavern, it has been observed that hieroglyphics
spring into sight where they have passed; initials and inscriptions
which the learned refuse to refer to any remote date. But the time will
come when these inscriptions will really be of remote date. And if
the professors of the future are anything like the professors of the
present, they will be able to deduce a vast number of very vivid and
interesting things from these cave-writings of the twentieth century.
If I know anything about the breed, and if they have not fallen away
from the full-blooded confidence of their fathers, they will be able
to discover the most fascinating facts about us from the initials left
in the Magic Grotto by 'Arry and 'Arriet, possibly in the form of
two intertwined A's. From this alone they will know (1) That as the
letters are rudely chipped with a blunt pocket knife, the twentieth
century possessed no delicate graving-tools and was unacquainted with
the art of sculpture. (2) That as the letters are capital letters,
our civilisation never evolved any small letters or anything like a
running hand. (3) That because initial consonants stand together in
an unpronounceable fashion, our language was possibly akin to Welsh
or more probably of the early Semitic type that ignored vowels. (4)
That as the initials of 'Arry and 'Arriet do not in any special
fashion profess to be religious symbols, our civilisation possessed no
religion. Perhaps the last is about the nearest to the truth; for a
civilisation that had religion would have a little more reason.

It is commonly affirmed, again, that religion grew in a very slow and
evolutionary manner; and even that it grew not from one cause; but from
a combination that might be called a coincidence. Generally speaking,
the three chief elements in the combination are, first, the fear of the
chief of the tribe (whom Mr. Wells insists on calling, with regrettable
familiarity, the Old Man), second, the phenomena of dreams, and third,
the sacrificial associations of the harvest and the resurrection
symbolised in the growing corn. I may remark in passing that it seems
to me very doubtful psychology to refer one living and single spirit
to three dead and disconnected causes, if they were merely dead and
disconnected causes. Suppose Mr. Wells, in one of his fascinating
novels of the future, were to tell us that there would arise among men
a new and as yet nameless passion, of which men will dream as they
dream of first love, for which they will die as they die for a flag
and a fatherland. I think we should be a little puzzled if he told us
that this singular sentiment would be a combination of the habit of
smoking Woodbines, the increase of the income tax and the pleasure of
a motorist in exceeding the speed limit. We could not easily imagine
this, because we could not imagine any connection between the three
or any common feeling that could include them all. Nor could anyone
imagine any connection between corn and dreams and an old chief with a
spear, unless there was already a common feeling to include them all.
But if there was such a common feeling it could only be the religious
feeling; and these things could not be the beginnings of a religious
feeling that existed already. I think anybody's common sense will tell
him that it is far more likely that this sort of mystical sentiment
did exist already; and that in the light of it dreams and kings and
corn-fields could appear mystical then, as they can appear mystical now.

For the plain truth is that all this is a trick of making things seem
distant and dehumanised, merely by pretending not to understand things
that we do understand. It is like saying that prehistoric men had an
ugly and uncouth habit of opening their mouths wide at intervals and
stuffing strange substances into them, as if we had never heard of
eating. It is like saying that the terrible Troglodytes of the Stone
Age lifted alternate legs in rotation, as if we never heard of walking.
If it were meant to touch the mystical nerve and awaken us to the
wonder of walking and eating, it might be a legitimate fancy. As it is
here intended to kill the mystical nerve and deaden us to the wonder
of religion, it is irrational rubbish. It pretends to find some thing
incomprehensible in the feelings that we all comprehend. Who does not
find dreams mysterious, and feel that they lie on the dark borderland
of being? Who does not feel the death and resurrection of the growing
things of the earth as something near to the secret of the universe?
Who does not understand that there must always be the savour of
something sacred about authority and the solidarity that is the soul of
the tribe? If there be any anthropologist who really finds these things
remote and impossible to realise, we can say nothing of that scientific
gentleman except that he has not got so large and enlightened a mind as
a primitive man. To me it seems obvious that nothing but a spiritual
sentiment already active could have clothed these separate and diverse
things with sanctity. To say that religion came from reverencing a
chief or sacrificing at a harvest is to put a highly elaborate cart
before a really primitive horse. It is like saying that the impulse to
draw pictures came from the contemplation of the pictures of reindeers
in the cave. In other words, it is explaining painting by saying that
it arose out of the work of painters; or accounting for art by saying
that it arose out of art. It is even more like saying that the thing
we call poetry arose as the result of certain customs; such as that of
an ode being officially composed to celebrate the advent of spring; or
that of a young man rising at a regular hour to listen to the skylark
and then writing his report on a piece of paper. It is quite true that
young men often become poets in the spring; and it is quite true that
when once there are poets, no mortal power can restrain them from
writing about the skylark But the poems did not exist before the poets.
The poetry did not arise out of the poetic forms. In other words, it is
hardly an adequate explanation of how a thing appeared for the first
time to say it existed already. Similarly, we cannot say that religion
arose out of the religious forms, because that is only another way of
saying that it only arose when it existed already. It needed a certain
sort of mind to see that there was anything mystical about the dreams
or the dead, as it needed a particular sort of mind to see that there
was any thing poetical about the skylark or the spring. That mind was
presumably what we call the human mind, very much as it exists to this
day; for mystics still meditate upon death and dreams as poets still
write about spring and skylarks. But there is not the faintest hint
to suggest that anything short of the human mind we know feels any of
these mystical associations at all. A cow in a field seems to derive no
lyrical impulse or instruction from her unrivalled opportunities for
listening to the skylark. And similarly there is no reason to suppose
that live sheep will ever begin to use dead sheep as the basis of a
system of elaborate ancestor-worship. It is true that in the spring
a young quadruped's fancy may lightly turn to thoughts of love, but
no succession of springs has ever led it to turn however lightly to
thoughts of literature. And in the same way, while it is true that a
dog has dreams, while most other quadrupeds do not seem even to have
that, we have waited a long time for the dog to develop his dreams into
an elaborate system or religious ceremonial. We have waited so long
that we have really ceased to expect it; and we no more look to see a
dog apply his dreams to ecclesiastical construction than to see him
examine his dreams by the rules of psycho-analysis. It is obvious, in
short, that for some reason or other these natural experiences, and
even natural excitements, never do pass the line that separates them
from creative expression like art and religion, in any creature except
man. They never do, they never have, and it is now to all appearance
very improbable that they ever will. It is not impossible, in the sense
of self-contradictory, that we should see cows fasting from grass every
Friday or going on their knees as in the old legend about Christmas
Eve. It is not in that sense impossible that cows should contemplate
death until they can lift up a sublime psalm of lamentation to the
tune the old cow died of. It is not in that sense impossible that they
should express their hopes of a heavenly career in a symbolic dance,
in honour of the cow that jumped over the moon. It may be that the dog
will at last have laid in a sufficient store of dreams to enable him to
build a temple to Cerberus as a sort of canine trinity. It may be that
his dreams have already begun to turn into visions capable of verbal
expression, in some revelation about the Dog Star as the spiritual home
for lost dogs. These things are logically possible, in the sense that
it is logically difficult to prove the universal negative which we call
an impossibility. But all that instinct for the probable, which we call
common sense, must long ago have told us that the animals are not to
all appearance evolving in that sense; and that, to say the least, we
are not likely to have any personal evidence of their passing from the
animal experience to the human experiments. But spring and death and
even dreams, considered merely as experiences, are their experiences as
much as ours. The only possible conclusion is that these experiences,
considered as experiences, do not generate anything like a religious
sense in any mind except a mind like ours. We come back to the fact of
a certain kind of mind that was already alive and alone. It was unique
and it could make creeds as it could make cave-drawings. The materials
for religion had lain there for countless ages like the materials for
everything else; but the power of religion was in the mind. Man could
already see in these things the riddles and hints and hopes that he
still sees in them. He could not only dream but dream about dreams.
He could not only see the dead but see the shadow of death; and was
possessed with that mysterious mystification that forever finds death
incredible.

It is quite true that we have even these hints chiefly about man when
he unmistakably appears as man. We cannot affirm this or anything else
about the alleged animal originally connecting man and the brutes.
But that is only because he is not an animal but an allegation. We
cannot be certain the Pithecanthropus ever worshipped, because we
cannot be certain that he ever lived. He is only a vision called up
to fill the void that does in fact yawn between the first creatures
who were certainly men and any other creatures that are certainly apes
or other animals. A few very doubtful fragments are scraped together
to suggest such an intermediate creature because it is required by a
certain philosophy; but nobody supposes that these are sufficient to
establish anything philosophical even in support of that philosophy. A
scrap of skull found in Java cannot establish anything about religion
or about the absence of religion. If there ever was any such ape-man,
he may have exhibited as much ritual in religion as a man or as much
simplicity in religion as an ape. He may have been a mythologist or he
may have been a myth. It might be interesting to inquire whether this
mystical quality appeared in a transition from the ape to the man, if
there were really any types of the transition to inquire about. In
other words, the missing link might or might not be mystical if he
were not missing. But compared with the evidence we have of real human
beings, we have no evidence that he was a human being or a half-human
being or a being at all. Even the most extreme evolutionists do not
attempt to deduce any evolutionary views about the origin of religion
from him. Even in trying to prove that religion grew slowly from rude
or irrational sources, they begin their proof with the first men who
were men. But their own proof only proves that the men who were already
men were already mystics. They used the rude and irrational elements
as only men and mystics can use them. We come back once more to the
simple truth; that at sometime too early for these critics to trace,
a transition had occurred to which bones and stones cannot in their
nature bear witness; and man became a living soul.

Touching this matter of the origin of religion, the truth is that
those who are thus trying to explain it are trying to explain it away.
Subconsciously they feel that it looks less formidable when thus
lengthened out into a gradual and almost invisible process. But in
fact this perspective entirely falsifies the reality of experience.
They bring together two things that are totally different, the stray
hints of evolutionary origins and the solid and self-evident block
of humanity, and try to shift their standpoint till they see them in
a single foreshortened line. But it is an optical illusion. Men do
not in fact stand related to monkeys or missing links in any such
chain as that in which men stand related to men. There may have been
intermediate creatures whose faint traces can be found here and there
in the huge gap. Of these beings, if they ever existed, it may be true
that they were things very unlike men or men very unlike ourselves. But
of prehistoric men, such as those called the cave-men or the reindeer
men, it is not true in any sense whatever. Prehistoric men of that sort
were things exactly like men and men exceedingly like our selves. They
only happened to be men about whom we do not know much, for the simple
reason that they have left no records or chronicles; but all that we
do know about them makes them just as human and ordinary as men in a
medieval manor or a Greek city.

Looking from our human standpoint up the long perspective of humanity,
we simply recognise this thing as human. If we had to recognise it as
animal we should have had to recognise it as abnormal. If we chose to
look through the other end of the telescope, as I have done more than
once in these speculations, if we chose to project the human figure
forward out of an unhuman world, we could only say that one of the
animals had obviously gone mad. But seeing the thing from the right
end, or rather from the inside, we know it is sanity; and we know that
these primitive men were sane. We hail a certain human freemasonry
wherever we see it, in savages, in foreigners or in historical
characters. For instance, all we can infer from primitive legend,
and all we know of barbaric life, supports a certain moral and even
mystical idea of which the commonest symbol is clothes. For clothes are
very literally vestments and man wears them because he is a priest. It
is true that even as an animal he is here different from the animals.
Nakedness is not nature to him; it is not his life but rather his
death; even in the vulgar sense of his death of cold. But clothes are
worn for dignity or decency or decoration where they are not in any way
wanted for warmth. It would sometimes appear that they are valued for
ornament before they are valued for use. It would almost always appear
that they are felt to have some connection with decorum. Conventions of
this sort vary a great deal with various times and places; and there
are some who cannot get over this reflection, and for whom it seems
a sufficient argument for letting all conventions slide. They never
tire of repeating, with simple wonder, that dress is different in the
Cannibal Islands and in Camden Town; they cannot get any further and
throw up the whole idea of decency in despair. They might as well say
that because there have been hats of a good many different shapes,
and some rather eccentric shapes, therefore hats do not matter or do
not exist. They would probably add that there is no such thing as
sunstroke or going bald. Men have felt everywhere that certain norms
were necessary to fence off and protect certain private things from
contempt or coarse misunderstanding; and the keeping of those forms,
whatever they were, made for dignity and mutual respect. The fact that
they mostly refer, more or less remotely, to the relations of the sexes
illustrates the two facts that must be put at the very beginning of the
record of the race. The first is the fact that original sin is really
original. Not merely in theology but in history it is a thing rooted in
the origins. Whatever else men have believed, they have all believed
that there is something the matter with mankind This sense of sin has
made it impossible to be natural and have no clothes, just as it has
made it impossible to be natural and have no laws. But above all it is
to be found in that other fact, which is the father and mother of all
laws as it is itself founded on a father and mother; the thing that is
before all thrones and even all commonwealths.

That fact is the family. Here again we must keep the enormous
proportions of a normal thing clear of various modifications and
degrees and doubts more or less reasonable, like clouds clinging
about a mountain. It may be that what we call the family had to fight
its way from or through various anarchies and aberrations; but it
certainly survived them and is quite as likely as not to have also
preceded them. As we shall see in the case of communism and nomadism,
more formless things could and did lie on the flank of societies that
had taken a fixed form; but there is nothing to show that the form
did not exist before the formlessness. What is vital is that form is
more important than formlessness; and that the material called mankind
has taken this form. For instance, of the rules revolving round sex,
which were recently mentioned, none is more curious than the savage
custom commonly called the couvade. That seems like a law out of
topsyturvydom; by which the father is treated as if he were the mother.
In any case it clearly involves the mystical sense of sex; but many
have maintained that it is really a symbolic act by which the father
accepts the responsibility of fatherhood. In that case that grotesque
antic is really a very solemn act; for it is the foundation of all we
call the family and all we know as human society. Some groping in these
dark beginnings have said that mankind was once under a matriarchy;
I suppose that under a matriarchy it would not be called mankind but
womankind. But others have conjectured that what is called matriarchy
was simply moral anarchy, in which the mother alone remained fixed
because all the fathers were fugitive and irresponsible. Then came the
moment when the man decided to guard and guide what he had created.
So he became the head of the family, not as a bully with a big club
to beat women with, but rather as a respectable person trying to be a
responsible person. Now all that might be perfectly true, and might
even have been the first family act, and it would still be true that
man then for the first time acted like a man, and therefore for the
first time became fully a man. But it might quite as well be true that
the matriarchy or moral anarchy, or whatever we call it, was only one
of the hundred social dissolutions or barbaric backslidings which may
have occurred at intervals in prehistoric as they certainly did in
historic times. A symbol like the couvade, if it was really such a
symbol, may have commemorated the suppression of a heresy rather than
the first rise of a religion. We cannot conclude with any certainty
about these things, except in their big results in the building of
mankind, but we can say in what style the bulk of it and the best of
it is built. We can say that the family is the unit of the state; that
it is the cell that makes up the formation. Round the family do indeed
gather the sanctities that separate men from ants and bees. Decency is
the curtain of that tent; liberty is the wall of that city; property is
but the family farm; honour is but the family flag. In the practical
proportions of human history, we come back to that fundamental of the
father and the mother and the child. It has been said already that if
this story cannot start with religious assumptions, it must none the
less start with some moral or metaphysical assumptions, or no sense can
be made of the story of man. And this is a very good instance of that
alternative necessity. If we are not of those who begin by invoking
a divine Trinity, we must none the less invoke a human Trinity; and
see that triangle repeated everywhere in the pattern of the world.
For the highest event in history, to which all history looks forward
and leads up, is only something that is at once the reversal and the
renewal of that triangle. Or rather it is the one triangle superimposed
so as to intersect the other, making a sacred pentacle of which, in a
mightier sense than that of the magicians, the fiends are afraid. The
old Trinity was of father and mother and child and is called the human
family. The new is of child and mother and father and has the name
of the Holy Family. It is in no way altered except in being entirely
reversed; just as the world which is transformed was not in the least
different, except in being turned upside-down.

III

THE ANTIQUITY OF CIVILISATION

The modern man looking at the most ancient origins has been like a man
watching for daybreak in a strange land; and expecting to see that
dawn breaking behind bare uplands or solitary peaks. But that dawn
is breaking behind the black bulk of great cities long builded and
lost for us in the original night; colossal cities like the houses of
giants, in which even the carved ornamental animals are taller than
the palm-trees; in which the painted portrait can be twelve times the
size of the man; with tombs like mountains of man set four-square and
pointing to the stars; with winged and bearded bulls standing and
staring enormous at the gates of temples; standing still eternally
as if a stamp would shake the world. The dawn of history reveals a
humanity already civilized. Perhaps it reveals a civilisation already
old. And among other more important things, it reveals the folly of
most of the generalisations about the previous and unknown period when
it was really young. The two first human societies of which we have any
reliable and detailed record are Babylon and Egypt. It so happens that
these two vast and splendid achievements of the genius of the ancients
bear witness against two of the commonest and crudest assumptions of
the culture of the moderns. If we want to get rid of half the nonsense
about nomads and cave-men and the old man of the forest, we need only
look steadily at the two solid and stupendous facts called Egypt and
Babylon.

Of course most of these speculators who are talking about primitive
men are thinking about modern savages. They prove their progressive
evolution by assuming that a great part of the human race has not
progressed or evolved; or even changed in any way at all. I do not
agree with their theory of change; nor do I agree with their dogma
of things unchangeable. I may not believe that civilised man has
had so rapid and recent a progress; but I cannot quite understand
why uncivilised man should be so mystically immortal and immutable.
A somewhat simpler mode of thought and speech seems to me to be
needed throughout this inquiry. Modern savages cannot be exactly like
primitive man, because they are not primitive. Modern savages are not
ancient because they are modern. Something has happened to their race
as much as to ours, during the thousands of years of our existence
and endurance on the earth. They have had some experiences, and have
presumably acted on them if not profited by them. Like the rest of us.
They have had some environment, and even some change of environment,
and have presumably adapted themselves to it in a proper and decorous
evolutionary manner. This would be true even if the experiences were
mild or the environment dreary; for there is an effect in mere time
when it takes the moral form of monotony. But it has appeared to a good
many intelligent and well-informed people quite as probable that the
experience of the savages has been that of a decline from civilisation.
Most of those who criticise this view do not seem to have any very
clear notion of what a decline from civilisation would be like. Heaven
help them, it is likely enough that they will soon find out. They seem
to be content if cave-men and cannibal islanders have some things in
common, such as certain particular implements. But it is obvious on
the face of it that any peoples reduced for any reason to a ruder
life would have some things in common. If we lost all our firearms we
should make bows and arrows; but we should not necessarily resemble in
every way the first men who made bows and arrows. It is said that the
Russians in their great retreat were so short of armament that they
fought with clubs cut in the wood. But a professor of the future would
err in supposing that the Russian army of 1916 was a naked Scythian
tribe that had never been out of the wood. It is like saying that a man
in his second childhood must exactly copy his first. A baby is bald
like an old man; but it would be an error for one ignorant of infancy
to infer that the baby had a long white beard. Both a baby and an old
man walk with difficulty; but he who shall expect the old gentleman to
lie on his back, and kick joyfully instead, will be disappointed.

It is therefore absurd to argue that the first pioneers of humanity
must have been identical with some of the last and most stagnant
leavings of it. There were almost certainly some things, there were
probably many things, in which the two were widely different or flatly
contrary. An example of the way in which this distinction works, and
an example essential to our argument here, is that of the nature and
origin of government I have already alluded to Mr. H. G. Wells and
the Old Man, with whom he appears to be on such intimate terms. If we
considered the cold facts of prehistoric evidence for this portrait of
the prehistoric chief of the tribe, we could only excuse it by saying
that its brilliant and versatile author simply forgot for a moment that
he was supposed to be writing a history, and dreamed he was writing
one of his own very wonderful and imaginative romances. At least I
cannot imagine how he can possibly know that the prehistoric ruler was
called the Old Man or that court etiquette requires it to be spelt with
capital letters. He says of the same potentate, 'No one was allowed to
touch his spear or to sit in his seat.' I have difficulty in believing
that anybody has dug up a prehistoric spear with a prehistoric label,
'Visitors are Requested not to Touch,' or a complete throne with the
inscription, 'Reserved for the Old Man.' But it may be presumed that
the writer, who can hardly be supposed to be merely making up things
out of his own head, was merely taking for granted this very dubious
parallel between the prehistoric and the decivilised man. It may be
that in certain savage tribes the chief is called the Old Man and
nobody is allowed to touch his spear or sit on his seat. It may be that
in those cases he is surrounded with superstitious and traditional
terrors; and it may be that in those cases, for all I know, he is
despotic and tyrannical. But there is not a grain of evidence that
primitive government was despotic and tyrannical. It may have been, of
course, for it may have been anything or even nothing; it may not have
existed at all. But the despotism in certain dingy and decayed tribes
in the twentieth century does not prove that the first men were ruled
despotically. It does not even suggest it; it does not even begin to
hint at it. If there is one fact we really can prove, from the history
that we really do know, it is that despotism can be a development,
often a late development and very often indeed the end of societies
that have been highly democratic. A despotism may almost be defined as
a tired democracy. As fatigue falls on a community, the citizens are
less inclined for that eternal vigilance which has truly been called
the price of liberty; and they prefer to arm only one single sentinel
to watch the city while they sleep. It is also true that they sometimes
needed him for some sudden and militant act of reform; it is equally
true that he often took advantage of being the strong man armed to
be a tyrant like some of the Sultans of the East. But I cannot see
why the Sultan should have appeared any earlier in history than many
other human figures. On the contrary, the strong man armed obviously
depends upon the superiority of his armour, and armament of that sort
comes with more complex civilisation. One man may kill twenty with a
machine-gum; it is obviously less likely that he could do it with a
piece of flint. As for the current cant about the strongest man ruling
by force and fear, it is simply a nursery fairy-tale about a giant with
a hundred hands. Twenty men could hold down the strongest strong man
in any society, ancient or modern. Undoubtedly they might admire, in
a romantic and poetical sense, the man who was really the strongest;
but that is quite a different thing, and is as purely moral and even
mystical as the admiration for the purest or the wisest. But the spirit
that endures the mere cruelties and caprices of an established despot
is the spirit of an ancient and settled and probably stiffened society,
not the spirit of a new one. As his name implies, the Old Man is the
ruler of an old humanity.

It is far more probable that a primitive society was something like
a pure democracy. To this day the comparatively simple agricultural
communities are by far the purest democracies. Democracy is a thing
which is always breaking down through the complexity of civilisation.
Anyone who likes may state it by saying that democracy is the foe
of civilisation. But he must remember that some of us really prefer
democracy to civilisation, in the sense of preferring democracy to
complexity. Anyhow, peasants tilling patches of their own land in a
rough equality, and meeting to vote directly under a village tree,
are the most truly self-governing of men. It is surely as likely as
not that such a simple idea was found in the first condition of even
simpler men. Indeed the despotic vision is exaggerated, even if we do
not regard the men as men. Even on an evolutionary assumption of the
most materialistic sort, there is really no reason why men should not
have had at least as much camaraderie as rats or rooks. Leadership
of some sort they doubtless had, as have the gregarious animals; but
leadership implies no such irrational servility as that attributed to
the superstitious subjects of the Old Man. There was doubtless some
body corresponding, to use Tennyson's expression, to the many-wintered
crow that leads the clanging rookery home. But I fancy that if that
venerable fowl began to act after the fashion of some Sultans in
ancient and decayed Asia, it would become a very clanging rookery and
the many-wintered crow would not see many more winters. It may be
remarked, in this connection, but even among animals it would seem that
something else is respected more than bestial violence, if it be only
the familiarity which in men is called tradition or the experience
which in men is called wisdom. I do not know if crows really follow
the oldest crow, but if they do they are certainly not following
the strongest crow. And I do know, in the human case, that if some
ritual of seniority keeps savages reverencing somebody called Old Man,
then at least they have not our own servile sentimental weakness for
worshipping the Strong Man.

It may be said then that primitive government, like primitive art and
religion and everything else, is very imperfectly known or rather
guessed at; but that it is at least as good a guess to suggest that
it was as popular as a Balkan or Pyrenean village as that it was as
capricious and secret as a Turkish divan. Both the mountain democracy
and the oriental palace are modern in the sense that they are still
there, or are some sort of growth of history; but of the two the palace
has much more the look of being an accumulation and a corruption, the
village much more the look of being a really unchanged and primitive
thing. But my suggestions at this point do not go beyond expressing a
wholesome doubt about the current assumption. I think it interesting,
for instance, that liberal institutions have been traced even by
moderns back to barbarians or undeveloped states, when it happened to
be convenient for the support of some race or nation or philosophy. So
the Socialists profess that their ideal of communal property existed
in very early times. So the Jews are proud of the Jubilees or juster
redistributions under their ancient law. So the Teutonists boasted of
tracing parliaments and juries and various popular things among the
Germanic tribes of the north. So the Celtophiles and those testifying
to the wrongs of Ireland have pleaded the more equal justice of the
clan system, to which the Irish chiefs bore witness before Strongbow.
The strength of the case varies in the different cases; but as there
is some case for all of them, I suspect there is some case for the
general proposition that popular institutions of some sort were by no
means uncommon in early and simple societies. Each of these separate
schools were making the admission to prove a particular modern thesis;
but taken together they suggest a more ancient and general truth, that
there was something more in prehistoric councils than ferocity and
fear. Each of these separate theorists had his own axe to grind, but
he was willing to use a stone axe; and he manages to suggest that the
stone axe might have been as republican as the guillotine.

But the truth is that the curtain rises upon the play already in
progress In one sense it is a true paradox that there was history
before history. But it is not the irrational paradox implied in
prehistoric history; for it is a history we do not know. Very probably
it was exceedingly like the history we do know, except in the one
detail that we do not know it. It is thus the very opposite of the
pretentious prehistoric history, which professes to trace everything
in a consistent course from the amoeba to the anthropoid and from the
anthropoid to the agnostic. So far from being a question of our knowing
all about queer creatures very different from ourselves, they were very
probably people very like ourselves, except that we know nothing about
them. In other words, our most ancient records only reach back to a
time when humanity had long been human, and even long been civilised.
The most ancient records we have not only mention but take for granted
things like kings and priests and princes and assemblies of the people;
they describe communities that are roughly recognisable as communities
in our own sense. Some of them are despotic; but we cannot tell that
they have always been despotic. Some of them may be already decadent
and nearly all are mentioned as if they were old. We do not know what
really happened in the world before those records; but the little we do
know would leave us anything but astonished if we learnt that it was
very much like what happens in this world now. There would be nothing
inconsistent or confounding about the discovery that those unknown ages
were full of republics collapsing under monarchies and rising again
as republics, empires expanding and finding colonies and then losing
colonies. Kingdoms combining again into world states and breaking
up again into small nationalities, classes selling themselves into
slavery and marching out once more into liberty; all that procession
of humanity which may or may not be a progress but most assuredly a
romance. But the first chapters of the romance have been torn out of
the book; and we shall never read them.

It is so also with the more special fancy about evolution and social
stability. According to the real records available, barbarism and
civilisation were not successive states in the progress of the
world. They were conditions that existed side by side, as they still
exist side by side. There were civilisations then as there are
civilisations now; there are savages now as there were savages then.
It is suggested that all men passed through a nomadic stage; but it
is certain that there are some who have never passed out of it, and
it seems not unlikely that there were some who never passed into it.
It is probable that from very primitive times the static tiller of
the soil and the wandering shepherd were two distinct types of men;
and the chronological rearrangement of them is but a mark of that
mania for progressive stages that has largely falsified history. It is
suggested that there was a communist stage, in which private property
was everywhere unknown, a whole humanity living on the negation of
property; but the evidences of this negation are themselves rather
negative. Redistributions of property, jubilees, and agrarian laws,
occur at various intervals and in various forms; but that humanity
inevitably passed through a communist stage seems as doubtful as the
parallel proposition that humanity will inevitably return to it. It is
chiefly interesting as evidence that the boldest plans for the future
invoke the authority of the past; and that even a revolutionary seeks
to satisfy himself that he is also a reactionary. There is an amusing
parallel example in the case of what is called feminism. In spite of
all the pseudo-scientific gossip about marriage by capture and the
cave-man beating the cave-woman with a club, it may be noted that as
soon as feminism became a fashionable cry, it was insisted that human
civilisation in its first stage had been a matriarchy. Apparently it
was the cave-woman who carried the club. Anyhow all these ideas are
little better than guesses; they have a curious way of following the
fortune of modern theories and fads. In any case they are not history
in the sense of record; and we may repeat that when it comes to record,
the broad truth is that barbarism and civilisation have always dwelt
side by side in the world, the civilisation sometimes spreading to
absorb the barbarians, sometimes decaying into relative barbarism, and
in almost all cases possessing in a more finished form certain ideas
and institutions which the barbarians possess in a ruder form; such as
government or social authority, the arts and especially the decorative
arts, mysteries and taboos of various kinds especially surrounding the
matter of sex, and some form of that fundamental thing which is the
chief concern of this enquiry; the thing that we call religion.

Now Egypt and Babylon, those two primeval monsters, might in this
matter have been specially provided as models. They might almost be
called working models to show how these modern theories do not work.
The two great truths we know about these two great cultures happen
to contradict flatly the two current fallacies which have just been
considered. The story of Egypt might have been invented to point the
moral that man does not necessarily begin with despotism because he
is barbarous, but very often finds his way to despotism because he is
civilised. He finds it because he is experienced; or, what is often
much the same thing, because he is exhausted And the story of Babylon
might have been invented to point the moral that man need not be a
nomad or a communist before he becomes a peasant or a citizen, and
that such cultures are not always in successive stages but often in
contemporary states. Even touching these great civilisations with which
our written history begins there is a temptation of course to be too
ingenious or too cocksure. We can read the bricks of Babylon in a very
different sense from that in which we guess about the Cup and Ring
stones; and we do definitely know what is meant by the animals in the
Egyptian hieroglyphic as we know nothing of the animal in the neolithic
cave. But even here the admirable archeologists who have deciphered
line after line of miles of hieroglyphics may be tempted to read too
much between the lines; even the real authority on Babylon may forget
how fragmentary is his hard-won knowledge; may forget that Babylon has
only heaved half a brick at him, though half a brick is better than no
cuneiform. But some truths, historic and not prehistoric, dogmatic and
not evolutionary, facts and not fancies, do indeed emerge from Egypt
and Babylon; and these two truths are among them.

Egypt is a green ribbon along the river edging the dark red desolation
of the desert. It is a proverb, and one of vast antiquity, that it
is created by the mysterious bounty and almost sinister benevolence
of the Nile. When we first hear of Egyptians they are living as in a
string of river-side villages, in small and separate but co-operative
communities along the bank of the Nile. Where the river branched into
the broad Delta there was traditionally the beginning of a somewhat
different district or people; but this need not complicate the main
truth. These more or less independent though interdependent peoples
were considerably civilised already. They had a sort of heraldry;
that is, decorative art used for symbolic and social purposes; each
sailing the Nile under its own ensign representing some bird or
animal. Heraldry involves two things of enormous importance to normal
humanity; the combination of the two making that noble thing called
co-operation; on which rest all peasantries and peoples that are
free. The art of heraldry means independence; an image chosen by the
imagination to express the individuality. The science of heraldry means
interdependence; an agreement between different bodies to recognise
different images; a science of imagery. We have here therefore exactly
that compromise of co-operation between free families or groups which
is the most normal mode of life for humanity and is particularly
apparent wherever men own their own land and live on it. With the very
mention of the image of bird and beast the student of mythology will
murmur the word 'totem' almost in his sleep. But to my mind much of the
trouble arises from his habit of saying such words as if in his sleep.
Throughout this rough outline I have made a necessarily inadequate
attempt to keep on the inside rather than the outside of such things;
to consider them where possible in terms of thought and not merely
in terms of terminology. There is very little value in talking about
totems unless we have some feeling of what it really felt like to have
a totem. Granted that they had totems and we have no totems; was it
because they had more fear of animals or more familiarity with animals?
Did a man whose totem was a wolf feel like a were-wolf or like a man
running away from a were-wolf? Did he feel like Uncle Remus about Brer
Wolf or like St. Francis about his brother the wolf, or like Mowgli
about his brothers the wolves? Was a totem a thing like the British
lion or a thing like the British bull-dog? Was the worship of a totem
like the feeling of niggers about Mumbo Jumbo, or of children about
Jumbo? I have never read any book of folk-lore, however learned, that
gave me any light upon this question, which I think by far the most
important one. I will confine myself to repeating that the earliest
Egyptian communities had a common understanding about the images
that stood for their individual states; and that this amount of
communication is prehistoric in the sense that it is already there at
the beginning of history. But as history unfolds itself, this question
of communication is clearly the main question of these riverside
communities. With the need of communication comes the need of a common
government and the growing greatness and spreading shadow of the king.
The other binding force besides the king, and perhaps older than the
king, is the priesthood; and the priesthood has presumably even more to
do with these ritual symbols and signals by which men can communicate.
And here in Egypt arose probably the primary and certainly the typical
invention to which we owe all history, and the whole difference between
the historic and the prehistoric: the archetypal script, the art of
writing.

The popular pictures of these primeval empires are not half so popular
as they might be. There is shed over them the shadow of an exaggerated
gloom, more than the normal and even healthy sadness of heathen men.
It is part of the same sort of secret pessimism that loves to make
primitive man a crawling creature, whose body is filth and whose soul
is fear. It comes of course from the fact that men are moved most by
their religion; especially when it is irreligion. For them anything
primary and elemental must be evil. But it is the curious consequence
that while we have been deluged with the wildest experiments in
primitive romance, they have all missed the real romance of being
primitive. They have described scenes that are wholly imaginary, in
which the men of the Stone Age are men of stone like walking statues;
in which the Assyrians or Egyptians are as stiff or as painted as
their own most archaic art. But none of these makers of imaginary
scenes have tried to imagine what it must really have been like to see
those things as fresh which we see as familiar. They have not seen a
man discovering fire like a child discovering fireworks. They have
not seen a man playing with the wonderful invention called the wheel,
like a boy playing at putting up a wireless station. They have never
put the spirit of youth into their descriptions of the youth of the
world. It follows that amid all their primitive or prehistoric fancies
there are no jokes. There are not even practical jokes, in connection
with the practical inventions. And this is very sharply defined in
the particular case of hieroglyphics; for there seems to be serious
indication that the whole high human art of scripture or writing began
with a joke.

There are some who will learn with regret that it seems to have begun
with a pun. The king or the priests or some responsible persons,
wishing to send a message up the river in that inconveniently long and
narrow territory, hit on the idea of sending it in picture writing,
like that of the Red Indian. Like most people who have written
picture-writing for fun, he found the words did not always fit. But
when the word for taxes sounded rather like the word for pig, he boldly
put down a pig as a bad pun and chanced it. So a modern hieroglyphist
might represent 'at once' by unscrupulously drawing a hat followed by
a series of upright numerals. It was good enough for the Pharaohs and
ought to be good enough for him. But it must have been great fun to
write or even to read these messages, when writing and reading were
really a new thing. And if people must write romances about ancient
Egypt (and it seems that neither prayers nor tears nor curses can
withhold them from the habit), I suggest that scenes like this would
really remind us that the ancient Egyptians were human beings. I
suggest that somebody should describe the scene of the great monarch
sitting among his priests, and all of them roaring with laughter and
bubbling over with suggestions as the royal puns grew more and more
wild and indefensible. There might be another scene of almost equal
excitement about the decoding of this cipher; the guesses and clues and
discoveries having all the popular thrill of a detective story. That is
how primitive romance and primitive history really ought to be written.
For whatever was the quality of the religious or moral life of remote
times, and it was probably much more human than is conventionally
supposed, the scientific interest of such a time must have been
intense. Words must have been more wonderful than wireless telegraphy;
and experiments with common things a series of electric shocks. We are
still waiting for somebody to write a lively story of primitive life.
The point is in some sense a parenthesis here; but it is connected
with the general matter of political development, by the institution
which was most active in these first and most fascinating of all the
fairy-tales of science.

It is admitted that we owe most of this science to the priests. Modern
writers like Mr. Wells cannot be accused of any weakness of sympathy
with a pontifical hierarchy; but they agree at least in recognising
what pagan priesthoods did for the arts and sciences. Among the more
ignorant of the enlightened there was indeed a convention of saying
that priests had obstructed progress in all ages; and a politician
once told me in a debate that I was resisting modern reforms exactly
as some ancient priest probably resisted the discovery of wheels. I
pointed out, in reply, that it was far more likely that the ancient
priest made the discovery of the wheels. It is overwhelmingly probable
that the ancient priest had a great deal to do with the discovery of
the art of writing. It is obvious enough in the fact that the very
word hieroglyphic is akin to the word hierarchy. The religion of these
priests was apparently a more or less tangled polytheism of a type
that is more particularly described elsewhere. It passed through a
period when it cooperated with the king, another period when it was
temporarily destroyed by the king, who happened to be a prince with
a private theism of his own, and a third period when it practically
destroyed the king and ruled in his stead. But the world has to thank
it for many things which it considers common and necessary: and the
creators of those common things ought really to have a place among the
heroes of humanity. If we were at rest in a real paganism, instead
of being restless in a rather irrational reaction from Christianity,
we might pay some sort of pagan honour to these nameless makers of
mankind. We might have veiled statues of the man who first found fire
or the man who first made a boat or the man who first tamed a horse.
And if we brought them garlands or sacrifices, there would be more
sense in it than in disfiguring our cities with cockney statues of
stale politicians and philanthropists. But one of the strange marks of
the strength of Christianity is that, since it came, no pagan in our
civilisation has been able to be really human.

The point is here, however, that the Egyptian government, whether
pontifical or royal, found it more and more necessary to establish
communication; and there always went with communication a certain
element of coercion. It is not necessarily an indefensible thing that
the state grew more despotic as it grew more civilised; it is arguable
that it had to grow more despotic in order to grow more civilised.
That is the argument for autocracy in every age; and the interest lies
in seeing it illustrated in the earliest age. But it is emphatically
not true that it was most despotic in the earliest age and grew more
liberal in a later age; the practical process of history is exactly
the reverse. It is not true that the tribe began in the extreme of
terror of the Old Man and his seat and spear; it is probable, at least
in Egypt, that the Old Man was rather a New Man armed to attack new
conditions. His spear grew longer and longer and his throne rose higher
and higher, as Egypt rose into a complex and complete civilisation.
That is what I mean by saying that the history of the Egyptian
territory is in this the history of the earth; and directly denies
the vulgar assumption that terrorism can only come at the beginning
and cannot come at the end. We do not know what was the very first
condition of the more or less feudal amalgam of land owners, peasants
and slaves in the little commonwealths beside the Nile; but it may have
been a peasantry of an even more popular sort. What we do know is that
it was by experience and education that little commonwealths lose their
liberty; that absolute sovereignty is something not merely ancient
but rather relatively modern; and it is at the end of the path called
progress that men return to the king.

Egypt exhibits, in that brief record of its remotest beginnings, the
primary problem of liberty and civilisation. It is the fact that men
actually lose variety by complexity. We have not solved the problem
properly any more than they did; but it vulgarises the human dignity
of the problem itself to suggest that even tyranny has no motive save
in tribal terror. And just as the Egyptian example refutes the fallacy
about despotism and civilisation, so does the Babylonian example
refute the fallacy about civilisation and barbarism. Babylon also we
first hear of when it is already civilised; for the simple reason
that we cannot hear of anything until it is educated enough to talk.
It talks to us in what is called cuneiform; that strange and stiff
triangular symbolism that contrasts with the picturesque alphabet of
Egypt. However relatively rigid Egyptian art may be, there is always
something different from the Babylonian spirit which was too rigid to
have any art. There is always a living grace in the lines of the lotus
and something of rapidity as well as rigidity in the movement of the
arrows and the birds. Perhaps there is something of the restrained but
living curve of the river, which makes us in talking of the serpent
of old Nile almost think of the Nile as a serpent. Babylon was a
civilisation of diagrams rather than of drawings. Mr. W.B. Yeats who
has a historical imagination to match his mythological imagination (and
indeed the former is impossible without the latter) wrote truly of the
men who watched the stars 'from their pedantic Babylon.' The cuneiform
was cut upon bricks, of which all their architecture was built up;
the bricks were of baked mud and perhaps the material had something
in it forbidding the sense of form to develop in sculpture or relief.
Theirs was a static but a scientific civilisation, far advanced in the
machinery of life and in some ways highly modern. It is said that they
had much of the modern cult of the higher spinsterhood and recognised
an official class of independent working women. There is perhaps
something in that mighty stronghold of hardened mud that suggests the
utilitarian activity of a huge hive. But though it was huge it was
human; we see many of the same social problems as in ancient Egypt
or modern England; and whatever its evils this also was one of the
earliest masterpieces of man. It stood, of course, in the triangle
formed by the almost legendary rivers of Tigris and Euphrates, and
the vast agriculture of its empire, on which its towns depended, was
perfected by a highly scientific system of canals. It had by tradition
a high intellectual life, though rather philosophic than artistic; and
there preside over its primal foundation those figures who have come to
stand for the star-gazing wisdom of antiquity; the teachers of Abraham;
the Chaldees.

Against this solid society, as against some vast bare wall of brick,
there surged age after age the nameless armies of the Nomads. They
came out of the deserts where the nomadic life had been lived from
the beginning and where it is still lived to-day. It is needless to
dwell on the nature of that life; it was obvious enough and even easy
enough to follow a herd or a flock which generally found its own
grazing-ground and to live on the milk or meat it provided. Nor is
there any reason to doubt that this habit of life could give almost
every human thing except a home. Many such shepherds or herds men
may have talked in the earliest time of all the truths and enigmas
of the Book of Job; and of these were Abraham and his children, who
have given to the modern world for an endless enigma the almost
mono-maniac monotheism of the Jews. But they were a wild people
without comprehension of complex social organisation; and a spirit
like the wind within them made them wage war on it again and again.
The history of Babylonia is largely the history of its defence against
the desert hordes; who came on at intervals of a century or two and
generally retreated as they came. Some say that an admixture of nomad
invasion built at Nineveh the arrogant kingdom of the Assyrians, who
carved great monsters upon their temples, bearded bulls with wings
like cherubim, and who sent forth many military conquerors who stamped
the world as if with such colossal hooves. Assyria was an imperial
interlude; but it was an interlude. The main story of all that land
is the war between the wandering peoples and the state that was truly
static. Presumably in prehistoric times, and certainly in historic
times, those wanderers went westward to waste whatever they could find.
The last time they came they found Babylon vanished; but that was in
historic times and the name of their leader was Mahomet.

Now it is worth while to pause upon that story because, as has been
suggested, it directly contradicts the impression still current
that nomadism is merely a prehistoric thing and social settlement
a comparatively recent thing. There is nothing to show that the
Babylonians had ever wandered; there is very little to show that the
tribes of the desert ever settled down. Indeed it is probable that
this notion of a nomadic stage followed by a static stage has already
been abandoned by the sincere and genuine scholars to whose researches
we all owe so much. But I am not at issue in this book with sincere
and genuine scholars, but with a vast and vague public opinion which
has been prematurely spread from certain imperfect investigations,
and which has made fashionable a false notion of the whole history
of humanity. It is the whole vague notion that a monkey evolved into
a man and in the same way a barbarian evolved into a civilised man
and therefore at every stage we have to look back to barbarism and
forward to civilisation. Unfortunately this notion is in a double sense
entirely in the air. It is an atmosphere in which men live rather than
a thesis which they defend. Men in that mood are more easily answered
by objects than by theories; and it will be well if anyone tempted to
make that assumption, in some trivial turn of talk or writing, can be
checked for a moment by shutting his eyes and seeing for an instant,
vast and vaguely crowded, like a populous precipice, the wonder of the
Babylonian wall.

One fact does certainly fall across us like its shadow. Our glimpses of
both these early empires show that the first domestic relation had been
complicated by something which was less human, but was often regarded
as equally domestic. The dark giant called Slavery had been called up
like a genius and was labouring on gigantic works of brick and stone.
Here again we must not too easily assume that what was backward was
barbaric; in the matter of manumission the earlier servitude seems in
some ways more liberal than the later; perhaps more liberal than the
servitude of the future. To insure food for humanity by forcing part of
it to work was after all a very human expedient; which is why it will
probably be tried again. But in one sense there is a significance in
the old slavery. It stands for one fundamental fact about all antiquity
before Christ; something to be assumed from first to last. It is the
insignificance of the individual before the State. It was as true
of the most democratic City State in Hellas as of any despotism in
Babylon. It is one of the signs of this spirit that a whole class of
individuals could be insignificant or even invisible. It must be normal
because it was needed for what would now be called 'social service.'
Somebody said, 'The Man is nothing and the Work is all,' meaning it
for a breezy Carlylean commonplace. It was the sinister motto of the
heathen Servile State. In that sense there is truth in the traditional
vision of vast pillars and pyramids going up under those everlasting
skies for ever by the labour of numberless and nameless men, toiling
like ants and dying like flies, wiped out by the work of their own
hands.

But there are two other reasons for beginning with the two fixed points
of Egypt and Babylon. For one thing they are fixed in tradition as the
types of antiquity; and history without tradition is dead. Babylon
is still the burden of a nursery rhyme, and Egypt (with its enormous
population of princesses awaiting reincarnation) is still the topic
of an unnecessary number of novels. But a tradition is generally a
truth; so long as the tradition is sufficiently popular; even if it
is almost vulgar. And there is a significance in this Babylonian and
Egyptian element in nursery rhymes and novels; even the news papers,
normally so much behind the times, have already got as far as the
reign of Tutankhamen. The first reason is full of the common sense of
popular legend; it is the simple fact that we do know more of these
traditional things than of other contemporary things; and that we
always did. All travellers from Herodotus to Lord Carnarvon follow
this route. Scientific speculations of to-day do indeed spread out a
map of the whole primitive world, with streams of racial emigration
or admixture marked in dotted lines everywhere; over spaces which the
unscientific medieval map-maker would have been content to call 'Terra
incognita,' if he did not fill the inviting blank with a picture of a
dragon, to indicate the probable reception given to pilgrims. But these
speculations are only speculations at the best; and at the worst the
dotted lines can be far more fabulous than the dragon.

There is unfortunately one fallacy here into which it is very easy for
men to fall, even those who are most intelligent and perhaps especially
those who are most imaginative. It is the fallacy of suppositing
that because an idea is greater in the sense of larger, therefore it
is greater in the sense of more fundamental and fixed and certain.
If a man lives alone in a straw hut in the middle of Thibet, he may
be told that he is living in the Chinese Empire; and the Chinese
Empire is certainly a splendid and spacious and impressive thing. Or
alternatively he may be told that he is living in the British Empire,
and be duly impressed. But the curious thing is that in certain mental
states he can feel much more certain about the Chinese Empire that
he can not see than about the straw hut that he can see. He has some
strange magical juggle in his mind, by which his argument begins with
the empire though his experience begins with the hut. Sometimes he
goes mad and appears to be proving that a straw hut cannot exist in
the domains of the Dragon Throne; that it is impossible for such a
civilisation as he enjoys to contain such a hovel as he inhabits.
But his insanity arises from the intellectual slip of supposing that
because China is a large and all-embracing hypothesis, therefore it is
something more than a hypothesis. Now modern people are perpetually
arguing in this way; and they extend it to things much less real and
certain than the Chinese Empire. They seem to forget, for instance,
that a man is not even certain of the Solar System as he is certain
of the South Downs. The Solar System is a deduction, and doubtless
a true deduction; but the point is that it is a very vast and
far-reaching deduction and therefore he forgets that it is a deduction
at all and treats it as a first principle. He might discover that the
whole calculation is a mis-calculation; and the sun and stars and
street-lamps would look exactly the same. But he has forgotten that
it is a calculation, and is almost ready to contradict the sun if it
does not fit into the solar system. If this is a fallacy even in the
case of facts pretty well ascertained, such as the Solar System and the
Chinese Empire, it is an even more devastating fallacy in connection
with theories and other things that are not really ascertained at all.
Thus history, especially prehistoric history, has a horrible habit of
beginning with certain generalisations about races. I will not describe
the disorder and misery this inversion has produced in modern politics.
Because the race is vaguely supposed to have produced the nation, men
talk as if the nation were something vaguer than the race. Because they
have themselves invented a reason to explain a result, they almost
deny the result in order to justify the reason. They first treat a
Celt as an axiom and then treat an Irishman as an inference. And then
they are surprised that a great fighting, roaring Irishman is angry at
being treated as an inference. They cannot see that the Irish are Irish
whether or no they are Celtic, whether or no there ever were any Celts.
And what misleads them once more is the size of the theory; the sense
that the fancy is bigger than the fact. A great scattered Celtic race
is supposed to contain the Irish, so of course the Irish must depend
for their very existence upon it. The same confusion, of course, has
eliminated the English and the Germans by swamping them in the Teutonic
race; and some tried to prove from the races being at one that the
nations could not be at war. But I only give these vulgar and hackneyed
examples in passing, as more familiar examples of the fallacy; the
matter at issue here is not its application to these modern things but
rather to the most ancient things. But the more remote and unrecorded
was the racial problem, the more fixed was this curious inverted
certainty in the Victorian man of science. To this day it gives a man
of those scientific traditions the same sort of shock to question these
things, which were only the last inferences when he turned them into
first principles. He is still more certain that he is an Aryan even
than that he is an Anglo-Saxon, just as he is more certain that he
is an Anglo-Saxon than that he is an Englishman. He has never really
discovered that he is a European. But he has never doubted that he
is an Indo-European. These Victorian theories have shifted a great
deal in their shape and scope; but this habit of a rapid hardening
of a hypothesis into a theory, and of a theory into an assumption,
has hardly yet gone out of fashion. People cannot easily get rid of
the mental confusion of feeling that the foundations of history must
surely be secure; that the first steps must be safe; that the biggest
generalisation must be obvious. But though the contradiction may seem
to them a paradox, this is the very contrary of the truth. It is the
large thing that is secret and invisible; it is the small thing that is
evident and enormous.

Every race on the face of the earth has been the subject of these
speculations, and it is impossible even to suggest an outline of the
subject. But if we take the European race alone, its history, or rather
its prehistory, has undergone many retrospective revolutions in the
short period of my own lifetime. It used to be called the Caucasian
race; and I read in childhood an account of its collision with the
Mongolian race; it was written by Bret Harte and opened with the query
'Or is the Caucasian played out?' Apparently the Caucasian was played
out, for in a very short time he had been turned into the Indo-European
man; sometimes, I regret to say, proudly presented as the Indo-Germanic
man. It seems that the Hindu and the German have similar words for
mother or father; there were other similarities between Sanskrit and
various Western tongues; and with that all superficial differences
between a Hindu and a German seemed suddenly to disappear. Generally
this composite person was more conveniently described as the Aryan,
and the really important point was that he had marched westward out of
those high lands of India where fragments of his language could still
be found. When I read this as a child, I had the fancy that after all
the Aryan need not have marched westward and left his language behind
him; he might also have marched eastward and taken his language with
him. If I were to read it now, I should content myself with confessing
my ignorance of the whole matter. But as a matter of fact I have great
difficulty in reading it now, because it is not being written now. It
looks as if the Aryan is also played out. Anyhow he has not merely
changed his name but changed his address; his starting-place and his
route of travel. One new theory maintains that our race did not come
to its present home from the East but from the South. Some say the
Europeans did not come from Asia but from Africa. Some have even had
the wild idea that the Europeans came from Europe; or rather that they
never left it.

Then there is a certain amount of evidence of a more or less
prehistoric pressure from the North, such as that which seems to have
brought the Greeks to inherit the Cretan culture and so often brought
the Gauls over the hills into the fields in Italy. But I merely mention
this example of European ethnology to point out that the learned have
pretty well boxed the compass by this time; and that I, who am not
one of the learned, cannot pretend for a moment to decide where such
doctors disagree. But I can use my own common sense, and I sometimes
fancy that theirs is a little rusty from want of use. The first act
of common sense is to recognise the difference between a cloud and a
mountain. And I will affirm that nobody knows any of these things, in
the sense that we all know of the existence of the Pyramids of Egypt.

The truth, it may be repeated, is that what we really see, as distinct
from what we may reasonably guess, in this earliest phase of history
is darkness covering the earth and great darkness the peoples, with a
light or two gleaming here and there on chance patches of humanity;
and that two of these flames do burn upon two of these tall primeval
towns; upon the high terraces of Babylon and the huge pyramids of
the Nile. There are indeed other ancient lights, or lights that may
be conjectured to be very ancient, in very remote parts of that vast
wilderness of night. Far away to the east there is a high civilisation
of vast antiquity in China; there are the remains of civilisations in
Mexico and South America and other places, some of them apparently
so high in civilisation as to have reached the most refined forms of
devil-worship. But the difference lies in the element old tradition;
the tradition of these lost cultures has been broken off, and though
the tradition of China still lives, it is doubtful whether we know
anything about it. Moreover, a man trying to measure the Chinese
antiquity has to use Chinese traditions of measurement; and he has a
strange sensation of having passed into another world under other laws
of time and space. Time is telescoped outwards and centuries assume the
slow and stiff movement of aeons; the white man trying to see it as the
yellow man sees, feels as if his head were turning round and wonders
wildly whether it is growing a pigtail. Any how he cannot take in a
scientific sense that queer perspective that leads up to the primeval
pagoda of the first of the Sons of Heaven. He is the real antipodes;
the only true alternative world to Christendom; and he is after a
fashion walking upside down. I have spoken of the medieval map-maker
and his dragon; but what medieval traveller, however much interested in
monsters, would expect to find a country where a dragon is a benevolent
and amiable being? Of the more serious side of Chinese tradition
something will be said in another connection; but I am only talking
of tradition and the test of antiquity. And I only mention China as
an antiquity that is not for us reached by a bridge old tradition;
and Babylon and Egypt as antiquities that are. Herodotus is a human
being, in a sense in which a Chinaman in a billy-cock hat, sitting
opposite to us in a London tea shop, is hardly human. We feel as if
we knew what David and Isaiah felt like, in a way in which we never
were quite certain what Li Hung Chang felt like. The very sins that
snatched away Helen or Bathsheba have passed into a proverb of private
human weakness, of pathos and even of pardon. The very virtues of the
Chinaman have about them something terrifying. This is the difference
made by the destruction or preservation of a continuous historical
inheritance; as from ancient Egypt to modern Europe. But when we ask
what was that world that we inherit, and why those particular people
and places seem to belong to it, we are led to the central fact of
civilised history.

That centre was the Mediterranean; which was not so much a piece of
water as a world. But it was a world with something of the character
of such a water; for it became more and more a place of unification in
which the streams of strange and very diverse cultures met. The Nile
and the Tiber alike flow into the Mediterranean; so did the Egyptian
and the Etrurian alike contribute to a Mediterranean civilisation. The
glamour of the great sea spread indeed very far in land and the unity
was felt among the Arabs alone in the deserts and the Gauls beyond
the northern hills. But the gradual building up of a common culture
running round all the coasts of this inner sea is the main business of
antiquity. As will be seen, it was sometimes a bad business as well
as a good business. In that orbis terrarum or circle of lands there
were the extremes of evil and of piety, there were contrasted races
and still more contrasted religions. It was the scene of an endless
struggle between Asia and Europe from the night of the Persian ships
at Salamis to the flight of the Turkish ships at Lepanto. It was
the scene, as will be more especially suggested later, of a supreme
spiritual struggle between the two types of paganism, confronting each
other in the Latin and the Phoenician cities; in the Roman forum and
the Punic mart. It was the world of war and peace, the world of good
and evil, the world of all that matters most, with all respect to the
Aztecs and the Mongols of the Far East, they did not matter as the
Mediterranean tradition mattered and still matters. Between it and the
Far East there were, of course, interesting cults and conquests of
various kinds, more or less in touch with it, and in proportion as they
were so intelligible also to us. The Persians came riding in to make an
end of Babylon; and we are told in a Greek story how these barbarians
learned to draw the bow and tell the truth. Alexander the great Greek
marched with his Macedonians into the sunrise and brought back strange
birds coloured like the sunrise clouds and strange flowers and jewels
from the gardens and treasuries of nameless kings. Islam went eastward
into that world and made it partly imaginable to us; precisely because
Islam itself was born in that circle of lands that fringed our own
ancient and ancestral sea. In the Middle Ages the empire of the Moguls
increased its majesty without losing its mystery; the Tartars conquered
China and the Chinese apparently took very little notice of them.
All these things are interesting in themselves; but it is impossible
to shift the centre of gravity to the inland spaces of Asia from the
inland sea of Europe. When all is said, if there were nothing in the
world but what was said and done and written and built in the lands
lying round the Mediterranean, it would still be in all the most vital
and valuable things the world in which we live. When that southern
culture spread to the north-west it produced many very wonderful
things; of which doubtless we ourselves are the most wonderful. When
it spread thence to colonies and new countries, it was still the same
culture so long as it was culture at all. But round that little sea
like a lake were the things themselves, apart from all extensions and
echoes and commentaries on the things, the Republic and the Church; the
Bible and the heroic epics; Islam and Israel and the memories of the
lost empires, Aristotle and the measure of all things. It is because
the first light upon this world is really light, the daylight in which
we are still walking to-day, and not merely the doubtful visitation
of strange stars, that I have begun here with noting where that light
first falls on the towered cities of the eastern Mediterranean.

But though Babylon and Egypt have thus a sort of first claim, in the
very fact of being familiar and traditional, fascinating riddles to us
but also fascinating riddles to our fathers, we must not imagine that
they were the only old civilisations on the southern sea; or that all
the civilisation was merely Sumerian or Semitic or Coptic, still less
merely Asiatic or African. Real research is more and more exalting the
ancient civilisation of Europe and especially of what we may still
vaguely call the Greeks. It must be understood in the sense that there
were Greeks before the Greeks, as in so many of their mythologies
there were gods before the gods. The island of Crete was the centre of
the civilisation now called Minoan, after the Minos who lingered in
ancient legend and whose labyrinth was actually discovered by modern
archeology. This elaborate European society, with its harbours and its
drainage and its domestic machinery, seems to have gone down before
some invasion of its northern neighbours, who made or inherited the
Hellas we know in history. But that earlier period did not pass till
it had given to the world gifts so great that the world has ever since
been striving in vain to repay them, if only by plagiarism.

Somewhere along the Ionian coast opposite Crete and the islands was a
town of some sort, probably of the sort that we should call a village
or hamlet with a wall. It was called Ilion but it came to be called
Troy, and the name will never perish from the earth. A poet who may
have been a beggar and a ballad-monger, who may have been unable to
read and write, and was described by tradition as a blind, composed a
poem about the Greeks going to war with this town to recover the most
beautiful woman in the world. That the most beautiful woman in the
world lived in that one little town sounds like a legend; that the most
beautiful poem in the world was written by somebody who knew of nothing
larger than such little towns is a historical fact. It is said that the
poem came at the end of the period; that the primitive culture brought
it forth in its decay; in which case one would like to have seen that
culture in its prime. But anyhow it is true that this, which is our
first poem, might very well be our last poem too. It might well be the
last word as well as the first word spoken by man about his mortal
lot, as seen by merely mortal vision. If the world becomes pagan and
perishes, the last man left alive would do well to quote the Iliad and
die.

But in this one great human revelation of antiquity there is another
element of great historical importance; which has hardly I think been
given its proper place in history. The poet has so conceived the poem
that his sympathies apparently, and those of his reader certainly,
are on the side of the vanquished rather than of the victor. And this
is a sentiment which increases in the poetical tradition even as the
poetical origin itself recedes. Achilles had some status as a sort of
demigod in pagan times; but he disappears altogether in late times. But
Hector grows greater as the ages pass, and it is his name that is the
name of a Knight of the Round Table and his sword that legend puts into
the hand of Roland, laying about him with the weapon of the defeated
Hector in the last ruin and splendour of his own defeat. The name
anticipates all the defeats through which our race and religion were to
pass; that survival of a hundred defeats that is its triumph.

The tale of the end of Troy shall have no ending, for it is lifted up
forever into living echoes, immortal as our hopelessness and our hope.
Troy standing was a small thing that may have stood nameless for ages.
But Troy falling has been caught up in a flame and suspended in an
immortal instant of annihilation; and because it was destroyed with
fire the fire shall never be destroyed. And as with the city so with
the hero; traced in archaic lines in that primeval twilight is found
the first figure of the Knight. There is a prophetic coincidence in his
title; we have spoken of the word chivalry and how it seems to mingle
the horseman with the horse. It is almost anticipated ages before in
the thunder of the Homeric hexameter, and that long leaping word with
which the Iliad ends. It is that very unity for which we can find no
name but the holy centaur of chivalry. But there are other reasons for
giving in this glimpse of antiquity the name upon the sacred town. The
sanctity of such towns ran like a fire round the coasts and islands of
the northern Mediterranean, the high-fenced hamlet for which heroes
died. From the smallness of the city came the greatness of the citizen.
Hellas with her hundred statues produced nothing statelier than that
walking statue; the ideal of the self-commanding man. Hellas of the
hundred statues was one legend and literature; and all that labyrinth
of little walled nations resounding with the lament of Troy.

A later legend, an afterthought but not an accident, said that
stragglers from Troy founded a republic on the Italian shore. It was
true in spirit that republican virtue had such a root. A mystery of
honour, that was not born of Babylon or the Egyptian pride, there shone
like the shield of Hector, defying Asia and Africa; till the light of a
new day was loosened, with the rushing of the eagles and the coming of
the name; the name that came like a thunderclap when the world woke to
Rome.

IV

GOD AND COMPARATIVE RELIGION

I was once escorted over the Roman foundations of an ancient British
city by a professor, who said something that seems to me a satire on a
good many other professors. Possibly the professor saw the joke, though
he maintained an iron gravity, and may or may not have realised that it
was a joke against a great deal of what is called comparative religion.
I pointed out a sculpture of the head of the sun with the usual halo
of rays, but with the difference that the face in the disc, instead
of being boyish like Apollo, was bearded like Neptune or Jupiter.
'Yes,' he said with a certain delicate exactitude, 'that is supposed
to represent the local god Sul. The best authorities identify Sul with
Minerva, but this has been held to show that the identification is not
complete.'

That is what we call a powerful understatement. The modern world is
madder than any satires on it; long ago Mr. Belloc made his burlesque
don say that a bust of Ariadne had been proved by modern research to be
a Silenus. But that is not better than the real appearance of Minerva
as the Bearded Woman of Mr. Barnum. Only both of them are very like
many identifications by 'the best authorities' on comparative religion;
and when Catholic creeds are identified with various wild myths, I do
not laugh or curse or misbehave myself; I confine myself decorously to
saying that the identification is not complete.

In the days of my youth the Religion of Humanity was a term commonly
applied to Comtism, the theory of certain rationalists who worshipped
corporate mankind as a Supreme Being. Even in the days of my youth,
I remarked that there was something slightly odd about despising and
dismissing the doctrine of the Trinity as a mystical and even maniacal
contradiction; and then asking us to adore a deity who is a hundred
million persons in one God, neither confounding the persons nor
dividing the substance.

But there is another entity, more or less definable and much more
imaginable than the many-headed and monstrous idol of mankind. And
it has a much better light to be called, in a reasonable sense, the
religion of humanity. Man is not indeed the idol; but man is almost
everywhere the idolator. And these multitudinous idolatries of man kind
have something about them in many ways more human and sympathetic than
modern metaphysical abstractions. If an Asiatic god has three heads and
seven arms, there is at least in it an idea of material incarnation
bringing an unknown power nearer to us and not farther away. But if
our friends Brown, Jones, and Robinson, when out for a Sunday walk,
were transformed and amalgamated into an Asiatic idol before our eyes,
they would surely seem farther away. If the arms of Brown and the legs
of Robinson waved from the same composite body, they would seem to be
waving something of a sad farewell. If the heads of an three gentlemen
appeared smiling on the same neck, we should hesitate even by what name
to address our new and somewhat abnormal friend. In the many-headed
and many-handed Oriental idol there is a certain sense of mysteries
be coming at least partly intelligible; of formless forces of nature
taking some dark but material form, but though this may be true of the
multiform god it is not so of the multiform man The human beings be
come less human by becoming less separate; we might say less human in
being less lonely. The human beings become less intelligible as they
become less isolated; we might say with strict truth that the closer
they are to us the farther they are away. An Ethical Hymn-book of this
humanitarian sort of religion was carefully selected and expurgated on
the principle of preserving anything human and eliminating anything
divine. One consequence was that a hymn appeared in the amended form
of 'Nearer Mankind to Thee, nearer to Thee.' It always suggested to me
the sensations of a strap-hanged during a crush on the Tube. But it
is strange and wonderful how far away the souls of men can seem, when
their bodies are so near as all that.

The human unity with which I deal here is not to be confounded with
this modern industrial monotony and herding, which is rather a
congestion than a communion. It is a thing to which human groups left
to themselves, and even human individuals left to themselves, have
everywhere tended by an instinct that may truly be called human. Like
all healthy human things, it has varied very much within the limits of
a general character; for that is characteristic of everything belonging
to that ancient land of liberty that lies before and around the servile
industrial town. Industrialism actually boasts that its products are
all of one pattern; that men in Jamaica or Japan can break the same
seal and drink the same bad whiskey, that a man at the North Pole and
another at the South might recognise the same optimistic level on the
same dubious tinned salmon. But wine, the gift of gods to men, can
vary with every valley and every vineyard, can turn into a hundred
wines without any wine once reminding us of whiskey; and cheeses can
change from county to county without forgetting the difference between
chalk and cheese. When I am speaking of this thing, therefore, I am
speaking of something that doubtless includes very wide differences;
nevertheless I will here maintain that it is one thing. I will maintain
that most of the modern botheration comes from not realising that it is
really one thing. I will advance the thesis that before all talk about
comparative religion and the separate religious founders of the world,
the first essential is to recognise this thing as a whole, as a thing
almost native and normal to the great fellowship that we call mankind.
This thing is Paganism, and I propose to show in these pages that it is
the one real rival to the Church of Christ.

Comparative religion is very comparative indeed. That is, it is so
much a matter of degree and distance and difference that it is only
comparatively successful when it tries to compare. When we come to
look at it closely we find it comparing things that are really quite
incomparable. We are accustomed to see a table or catalogue of the
world's great religions in parallel columns, until we fancy they are
really parallel. We are accustomed to see the names of the great
religious founders all in a row: Christ; Mahomet; Buddha; Confucius.
But in truth this is only a trick, another of these optical illusions
by which any objects may be put into a particular relation by shifting
to a particular point of sight. Those religions and religious
founders, or rather those whom we choose to lump together as religions
and religious founders, do not really show any common character.
The illusion is partly produced by Islam coming immediately after
Christianity in the list; as Islam did come after Christianity and was
largely an imitation of Christianity. But the other eastern religions,
or what we call religions, not only do not resemble the Church but do
not resemble each other. When we come to Confucianism at the end of the
list, we come to something in a totally different world of thought.
To compare the Christian and Confucian religions is like comparing a
theist with an English squire or asking whether a man is a believer
in immortality or a hundred-per-cent American. Confucianism may be a
civilisation but it is not a religion.

In truth the Church is too unique to prove herself unique. For most
popular and easy proof is by parallel; and here there is no parallel.
It is not easy, therefore, to expose the fallacy by which a false
classification is created to swamp a unique thing, when it really is
a unique thing. As there is nowhere else exactly the same fact, so
there is nowhere else exactly the same fallacy. But I will take the
nearest thing I can find to such a solitary social phenomenon, in
order to show how it is thus swamped and assimilated. I imagine most
of us would agree that there is something unusual and unique about the
position of the Jews. There is nothing that is quite in the same sense
an international nation; an ancient culture scattered in different
countries but still distinct and indestructible. Now this business is
like an attempt to make a list of Nomadic Nations in order to soften
the strange solitude of the Jew. It would be easy enough to do it, by
the same process of putting a plausible approximation first, and then
tailing off into totally different things thrown in somehow to make
up the list. Thus in the new list of nomadic nations the Jews would
be followed by the Gypsies; who at least are really nomadic if they
are not really national. Then the professor of the new science of
Comparative Nomadics could pass easily on to something different; even
if it was very different. He could remark on the wandering adventure
of the English who had scattered their colonies over so many seas;
and call them nomads. It is quite true that a great many Englishmen
seem to be strangely restless in England. It is quite true that not
all of them have left their country for their country's good. The
moment we mention the wandering empire of the English, we must add the
strange exiled empire of the Irish. For it is a curious fact, to be
noted in our imperial literature, that the same ubiquity and unrest
which is a proof of English enterprise and triumph is a proof of Irish
futility and failure. Then the professor of Nomadism would look round
thoughtfully and remember that there was great talk recently of German
waiters, German barbers, German clerks, Germans naturalising themselves
in England and the United States and the South American republics. The
Germans would go down as the fifth nomadic race; the words Wanderlust
and Folk-Wandering would come in very useful here. For there really
have been historians who explained the Crusades by suggesting that
the Germans were found wandering (as the police say) in what happened
to be the neighbourhood of Palestine. Then the professor, feeling he
was now near the end, would make a last leap in desperation. He would
recall the fact that the French army has captured nearly every capital
in Europe, that it marched across countless conquered lands under
Charlemagne or Napoleon; and that would be wanderlust and that would be
the note of a nomadic race. Thus he would have his six nomadic nations
all compact and complete, and would feel that the Jew was no longer a
sort of mysterious and even mystical exception. But people with more
common sense would probably realise that he had only extended nomadism
by extending the meaning of nomadism, and that he had extended that
until it really had no meaning at all. It is quite true that the French
soldier has made some of the finest marches in all military history.
But it is equally true, and far more self-evident, that if the French
peasant is not a rooted reality there is no such thing as a rooted
reality in the world; or in other words, if he is a nomad there is
nobody who is not a nomad.

Now that is the sort of trick that has been tried in the case of
comparative religion and the world's religious founders all standing
respectably in a row. It seeks to classify Jesus as the other would
classify Jews, by inventing a new class for the purpose and filling up
the rest of it with stop-gaps and second-rate copies. I do not mean
that these other things are not often great things in their own real
character and class. Confucianism and Buddhism are great things, but it
is not true to call them Churches; just as the French and English are
great peoples, but it is nonsense to call them nomads. There are some
points of resemblance between Christendom and its imitation in Islam;
for that matter there are some points of resemblance between Jews and
Gypsies. But after that the lists are made up of anything that comes to
hand; of anything that can be put in the same catalogue without being
in the same category.

In this sketch of religious history, with all decent deference to men
much more learned than myself, I propose to cut across and disregard
this modern method of classification, which I feel sure has falsified
the facts of history. I shall here submit an alternative classification
of religion or religions, which I believe would be found to cover
all the facts and, what is quite as important here, all the fancies.
Instead of dividing religion geographically and as it were vertically,
into Christian, Moslem, Brahmin, Buddhist, and so on, I would divide
it psychologically and in some sense horizontally; into the strata of
spiritual elements and influences that could sometimes exist in the
same country, or even in the same man. Putting the Church apart for
the moment, I should be disposed to divide the natural religion of
the mass of mankind under such headings as these: God; the Gods; the
Demons; the Philosophers. I believe some such classification will help
us to sort out the spiritual experiences of men much more successfully
than the conventional business of comparing religions; and that many
famous figures will naturally fall into their place in this way who
are only forced into their place in the other. As I shall make use of
these titles or terms more than once in narrative and allusion, it will
be well to define at this stage for what I mean them to stand. And I
will begin with the first, the simplest and the most sublime, in this
chapter.

In considering the elements of pagan humanity, we must begin by an
attempt to describe the indescribable. Many get over the difficulty
of describing it by the expedient of denying it, or at least ignoring
it; but the whole point of it is that it was something that was never
quite eliminated even when it was ignored. They are obsessed by their
evolutionary monomania that every great thing grows from a seed, or
something smaller than itself. They seem to forget that every seed
comes from a tree, or something larger than itself. Now there is very
good ground for guessing that religion did not originally come from
some detail that was forgotten, because it was too small to be traced.
Much more probably it was an idea that was abandoned because it was too
large to be managed. There is very good reason to suppose that many
people did begin with the simple but overwhelming idea of one God who
governs all; and afterwards fell away into such things as demon-worship
almost as a sort of secret dissipation. Even the test of savage
beliefs, of which the folk-lore students are so fond, is admittedly
often found to support such a view. Some of the very rudest savages,
primitive in every sense in which anthropologists use the word, the
Australian aborigines for instance, are found to have a pure monotheism
with a high moral tone. A missionary was preaching to a very wild tribe
of polytheists, who had told him all their polytheistic tales, and
telling them in return of the existence of the one good God who is a
spirit and judges men by spiritual standards. And there was a sudden
buzz of excitement among these stolid barbarians, as at somebody who
was letting out a secret, and they cried to each other, 'Atahocan! He
is speaking of Atahocan!'

Probably it was a point of politeness and even decency among those
polytheists not to speak of Atahocan. The name is not perhaps so much
adapted as some of our own to direct and solemn religious exhortation
but many other social forces are always covering up and confusing
such simple ideas. Possibly the old god stood for an old morality
found irksome in more expansive moments; possibly intercourse with
demons was more fashionable among the best people, as in the modern
fashion of Spiritualism. Anyhow, there are any number of similar
examples. They all testify to the unmistakable psychology of a thing
taken for granted, as distinct from a thing talked about. There is a
striking example in a tale taken down word for word from a Red Indian
in California which starts out with hearty legendary and literary
relish: 'The sun is the father and ruler of the heavens. He is the big
chief. The moon is his wife and the stars are their children'; and so
on through a most ingenious and complicated story, in the middle of
which is a sudden parenthesis saying that the sun and moon have to do
something because 'It is ordered that way by the Great Spirit Who lives
above the place of all.' That is exactly the attitude of most paganism
towards God. He is something assumed and forgotten and remembered
by accident; a habit possibly not peculiar to pagans. Sometimes the
higher deity is remembered in the higher moral grades and is a sort of
mystery. But always, it has been truly said, the savage is talkative
about his mythology and taciturn about his religion. The Australian
savages, indeed, exhibit a topsyturveydom such as the ancients might
have thought truly worthy of the antipodes. The savage who thinks
nothing of tossing off such a trifle as a tale of the sun and moon
being the halves of a baby chopped in two, or dropping into small-talk
about a colossal cosmic cow milked to make the rain, merely in order to
be sociable, will then retire to secret caverns sealed against women
and white men, temples of terrible initiation where to the thunder
of the bull-roarer and the dripping of sacrificial blood, the priest
whispers the final secrets, known only to the initiate: that honesty is
the best policy, that a little kindness does nobody any harm, that all
men are brothers and that there is but one God, the Father Almighty,
maker of all things visible and invisible.

In other words, we have here the curiosity of religious history that
the savage seems to be parading all the most repulsive and impossible
parts of his belief and concealing all the most sensible and creditable
parts. But the explanation is that they are not in that sense parts of
his belief, or at least not parts of the same sort of belief. The myths
are merely tall stories, though as tall as the sky, the water spout,
or the tropic rain. The mysteries are true stories, and are taken
secretly that they may be taken seriously. Indeed it is only too easy
to forget that there is a thrill in theism. A novel in which a number
of separate characters all turned out to be the same character would
certainly be a sensational novel. It is so with the idea that sun and
tree and river are the disguises of one god and not of many. Alas, we
also find it only too easy to take Atahocan for granted. But whether
he is allowed to fade into a truism or preserved as a sensation by
being preserved as a secret, it is clear that he is always either an
old truism or an old tradition. There is nothing to show that he is an
improved product of the mere mythology and everything to show that he
preceded it. He is worshipped by the simplest tribes with no trace of
ghosts or grave-offerings, or any of the complications in which Herbert
Spencer and Grant Allen sought the origin of the simplest of all ideas.
Whatever else there was, there was never as such thing as the Evolution
of the Idea of God. The idea was concealed, was avoided, was almost
forgotten, was even explained away; but it was never evolved.

There are not a few indications of this change in other places It is
implied, for instance, in the fact that even polytheism seems often
the combination of several monotheisms. A god will gain only a minor
seat on Mount Olympus, when he had owned earth and heaven and all the
stars while he lived in his own little valley. Like many a small nation
melting in a great empire, he gives up local universality only to come
under universal limitation. The very name of Pan suggests that he
became a god of the wood when he had been a god of the world. The very
name of Jupiter is almost a pagan translation of the words 'Our Father
which art in heaven.' As with the Great Father symbolised by the sky,
so with the Great Mother whom we still call Mother Earth. Demeter and
Ceres and Cybele often seem to be almost capable of taking over the
whole business of godhood, so that men should need no other gods. It
seems reasonably probable that a good many men did have no other gods
but one of these, worshipped as the author of all.

Over some of the most immense and populous tracts of the world such
as China, it would seem that the simpler idea of the Great Father has
never been very much complicated with rival cults, though it may have
in some sense ceased to be a cult itself. The best authorities seem
to think that though Confucianism is in one sense agnosticism, it
does not directly contradict the old theism, precisely because it has
become a rather vague theism. It is one in which God is called Heaven,
as in the case of polite persons tempted to swear in drawing-rooms.
But Heaven is still overhead, even if it is very far overhead. We have
all the impression of a simple truth that has receded, until it was
remote without ceasing to be true. And this phrase alone would bring
us back to the same idea even in the pagan mythology of the West.
There is surely something of this very notion of the withdrawal of
some higher power, in all those mysterious and very imaginative myths
about the separation of earth and sky. In a hundred forms we are told
that heaven and earth were once lovers, or were once at one, when some
upstart thing, often some undutiful child, thrust them apart; and the
world was built on an abyss; upon a division and a parting. One of its
grossest versions was given by Greek civilisation in the myth of Uranus
and Saturn. One of its most charming versions was that of some savage
niggers, who say that a little pepper-plant grew taller and taller
and lifted the whole sky like a lid; a beautiful barbaric vision of
daybreak for some of our painters who love that tropical twilight. Of
myths, and the highly mythical explanations which the moderns offer
of myths, something will be said in another section; for I cannot but
think that most mythology is on another and more superficial plane.
But in this primeval vision of the rending of one world into two there
is surely something more of ultimate ideas. As to what it means, a
man will learn far more about it by lying on his back in a field, and
merely looking at the sky, than by reading all the libraries even of
the most learned and valuable folklore. He will know what is meant by
saying that the sky ought to be nearer to us than it is, that perhaps
it was once nearer than it is, that it is not a thing merely alien
and abysmal but in some fashion sundered from us and saying farewell.
There will creep across his mind the curious suggestion that after
all, perhaps, the myth-maker was not merely a moon-calf or village
idiot thinking he could cut up the clouds like a cake, but had in him
something more than it is fashionable to attribute to the Troglodyte;
that it is just possible that Thomas Hood was not talking like a
Troglodyte when he said that, as time went on, the tree-tops only told
him he was further off from heaven than when he was a boy. But anyhow
the legend of Uranus the Lord of Heaven dethroned by Saturn the Time
Spirit would mean something to the author of that poem. And it would
mean, among other things, this banishment of the first fatherhood.
There is the idea of God in the very notion that there were gods before
the gods. There is an idea of greater simplicity in all the allusions
to that more ancient order. The suggestion is supported by the process
of propagation we see in historic times. Gods and demigods and heroes
breed like herrings before our very eyes and suggest of themselves that
the family may have had one founder; mythology grows more and more
complicated, and the very complication suggests that at the beginning
it was more simple. Even on the external evidence, of the sort called
scientific, there is therefore a very good case for the suggestion
that man began with monotheism before it developed or degenerated into
polytheism. But I am concerned rather with an internal than an external
truth; and, as I have already said, the internal truth is almost
indescribable. We have to speak of something of which it is the whole
point that people did not speak of it; we have not merely to translate
from a strange tongue or speech, but from a strange silence.

I suspect an immense implication behind all polytheism and paganism.
I suspect we have only a hint of it here and there in these savage
creeds or Greek origins. It is not exactly what we mean by the presence
of God; in a sense it might more truly be called the absence of God.
But absence does not mean non-existence; and a man drinking the toast
of absent friends does not mean that from his life all friendship
is absent. It is a void but it is not a negation; it is some thing
as positive as an empty chair. It would be an exaggeration to say
that the pagan saw higher than Olympus an empty throne. It would be
nearer the truth to take the gigantic imagery of the Old Testament, in
which the prophet saw God from behind; it was as if some immeasurable
presence had turned its back on the world. Yet the meaning will again
be missed, if it is supposed to be anything so conscious and vivid as
the monotheism of Moses and his people. I do not mean that the pagan
peoples were in the least overpowered by this idea merely because it is
overpowering. On the contrary, it was so large that they all carried
it lightly, as we all carry the load of the sky. Gazing at some detail
like a bird or a cloud, we can all ignore its awful blue background; we
can neglect the sky; and precisely because it bears down upon us with
an annihilating force it is felt as nothing. A thing of this kind can
only be an impressing and a rather subtle impression; but to me it is a
very strong impression made by pagan literature and religion. I repeat
that in our special sacramental sense there is, of course, the absence
of the presence of God. But there is in a very real sense the presence
of the absence of God. We feel it in the unfathomable sadness of pagan
poetry; for I doubt if there was ever in all the marvellous manhood of
antiquity a man who was happy as St. Francis was happy. We feel it in
the legend of a Golden Age and again in the vague implication that the
gods themselves are ultimately related to something else, even when
that Unknown God has faded into a Fate. Above all we feel it in those
immortal moments when the pagan literature seems to return to a more
innocent antiquity and speak with a more direct voice, so that no word
is worthy of it except our own monotheistic monosyllable. We cannot say
anything but 'God' in a sentence like that of Socrates bidding farewell
to his judges: 'I go to die and you remain to live; and God alone
knows which of us goes the better way.' We can use no other word even
for the best moments of Marcus Aurelius: 'Can they say dear city of
Cecrops, and canst thou not say dear city of God?' We can use no other
word in that mighty line in which Virgil spoke to all who suffer with
the veritable cry of a Christian before Christ: 'O you that have borne
things more terrible, to this also God shall give an end.'

In short, there is a feeling that there is something higher than
the gods; but because it is higher it is also further away. Not yet
could even Virgil have read the riddle and the paradox of that other
divinity, who is both higher and nearer. For them what was truly divine
was very distant, so distant that they dismissed it more and more from
their minds. It had less and less to do with the mere mythology of
which I shall write later. Yet even in this there was a sort of tacit
admission of its intangible purity, when we consider what most of the
mythologies like. As the Jews would not degrade it by images, so the
Greeks did not degrade it even by imaginations. When the gods were more
and more remembered only by pranks and profligacies, it was relatively
a movement of reverence. It was an act of piety to forget God. In other
words, there is something in the whole tone of the time suggesting that
men had accepted a lower level, and still were half conscious that it
was a lower level. It is hard to find words for these things; yet the
one really just word stands ready. These men were conscious of the
Fall if they were conscious of nothing else; and the same is true of
an heathen humanity. Those who have fallen may remember the fall, even
when they forget the height. Some such tantalising blank or break in
memory is at the back of all pagan sentiment. There is such a thing as
the momentary power to remember that we forget. And the most ignorant
of humanity know by the very look of earth that they have forgotten
heaven. But it remains true that even for these men there were moments,
like the memories of childhood, when they heard themselves talking with
a simpler language; there were moments when the Roman, like Virgil in
the line already quoted, cut his way with a sword-stroke of song out
of the tangle of the mythologies, the motley mob of gods and goddesses
sank suddenly out of sight and the Sky-Father was alone in the sky.

This latter example is very relevant to the next step in the process.
A white light as of a lost morning still lingers on the figure of
Jupiter, of Pan or of the elder Apollo; and it may well be, as
already noted, that each was once a divinity as solitary as Jehovah
or Allah. They lost this lonely universality by a process it is here
very necessary to note; a process of amalgamation very like what was
afterwards called syncretism. The whole pagan world set itself to
build a Pantheon. They admitted more and more gods, gods not only of
the Greeks but of the barbarians; gods not only of Europe but of Asia
and Africa. The more the merrier, though some of the Asian and African
ones were not very merry. They admitted them to equal thrones with
their own, sometimes they identified them with their own. They may have
regarded it as an enrichment of their religious life; but it meant the
final loss of all that we now call religion. It meant that ancient
light of simplicity, that had a single source like the sun, finally
fades away in a dazzle of conflicting Lights and colours. God is really
sacrificed to the Gods; in a very literal sense of the flippant phrase,
they have been too many for him.

Polytheism, therefore, was really a sort of pool; in the sense of the
pagans having consented to the pooling of their pagan religions. And
this point is very important in many controversies ancient and modern.
It is regarded as a liberal and enlightened thing to say that the god
of the stranger may be as good as our own; and doubtless the pagans
thought themselves very liberal and enlightened when they agreed to
add to the gods of the city or the hearth some wild and fantastic
Dionysus coming down from the mountains or some shaggy and rustic Pan
creeping out of the woods. But exactly what it lost by these larger
ideas is the largest idea of all. It is the idea of the fatherhood that
makes the whole world one. And the converse is also true. Doubtless
those more antiquated men of antiquity who clung to their solitary
statues and their single sacred names were regarded as superstitious
savages benighted and left behind. But these superstitious savages
were preserving something that is much more like the cosmic power as
conceived by philosophy, or even as conceived by science. This paradox
by which the rude reactionary was a sort of prophetic progressive
has one consequence very much to the point. In a purely historical
sense, and apart from any other controversies in the same connection,
it throws a light, a single and a steady light, that shines from the
beginning on a little and lonely people. In this paradox, as in some
riddle of religion of which the answer was sealed up for centuries,
lies the mission and the meaning of the Jews.

It is true in this sense, humanly speaking, that the world owes God
to the Jews. It owes that truth to much that is blamed on the Jews,
possibly to much that is blameable in the Jews. We have already noted
the nomadic position of the Jews amid the other pastoral peoples upon
the fringe of the Babylonian Empire, and something of that strange
erratic course of theirs blazed across the dark territory of extreme
antiquity, as they passed from the seat of Abraham and the shepherd
princes into Egypt and doubled back into the Palestinian hills and held
them against the Philistines from Crete and fell into captivity in
Babylon; and yet again returned to their mountain city by the Zionist
policy of the Persian conquerors; and so continued that amazing romance
of restlessness of which we have not yet seen the end. But through all
their wanderings, and especially through all their early wanderings,
they did indeed carry the fate of the world in that wooden tabernacle,
that held perhaps a featureless symbol and certainly an invisible god.
We may say that one most essential feature was that it was featureless.
Much as we may prefer that creative liberty which the Christian culture
has declared and by which it has eclipsed even the arts of antiquity,
we must not underrate the determining importance at the time of the
Hebrew inhibition of images. It is a typical example of one of those
limitations that did in fact preserve and perpetuate enlargement,
like a wall built round a wide open space. The God who could not have
a statue remained a spirit. Nor would his statue in any case have
had the disarming dignity and grace of the Greek statues then or the
Christian statues afterwards. He was living in a land of monsters. We
shall have occasion to consider more fully what those monsters were,
Moloch and Dagon and Tanit the terrible goddess. If the deity of Israel
had ever had an image, he would have had a phallic image. By merely
giving him a body they would have brought in all the worst elements
of mythology; all the polygamy of polytheism; the vision of the harem
in heaven. This point about the refusal of art is the first example
of the limitations which are often adversely criticised, only because
the critics themselves are limited. But an even stronger case can be
found in the other criticism offered by the same critics. It is often
said with a sneer that the God of Israel was only a God of battles, 'a
mere barbaric Lord of Hosts' pitted in rivalry against other gods only
as their envious foe. Well it is for the world that he was a God of
Battles. Well it is for us that he was to all the rest only a rival and
a foe. In the ordinary way, it would have been only too easy for them
to have achieved the desolate disaster of conceiving him as a friend.
It would have been only too easy for them to have seen him stretching
out his hands in love and reconciliation, embracing Baal and kissing
the painted face of Astarte, feasting in fellowship with the gods;
the last god to sell his crown of stars for the Soma of the Indian
pantheon or the nectar of Olympus or the mead of Valhalla. It would
have been easy enough for his worshippers to follow the enlightened
course of Syncretism and the pooling of all the pagan traditions. It is
obvious indeed that his followers were always sliding down this easy
slope; and it required the almost demoniac energy of certain inspired
demagogues, who testified to the divine unity in words that are still
like winds of inspiration and ruin. The more we really understand of
the ancient conditions that contributed to the final culture of the
Faith, the more we shall have a real and even a realistic reverence for
the greatness of the Prophets of Israel. As it was, while the whole
world melted into this mass of confused mythology, this Deity who is
called tribal and narrow, precisely because he was what is called
tribal and narrow, preserved the primary religion of all mankind. He
was tribal enough to be universal. He was as narrow as the universe.
In a word, there was a popular pagan god called Jupiter-Ammon. There
was never a god called Jehovah-Ammon. There was never a god called
Jehovah-Jupiter. If there had been, there would certainly have been
another called Jehovah-Moloch. Long before the liberal and enlightened
amalgamators had got so far afield as Jupiter, the image of the Lord of
Hosts would have been deformed out of all suggestion of a monotheistic
maker and ruler and would have become an idol far worse than any savage
fetish; for he might have been as civilised as the gods of Tyre and
Carthage. What that civilisation meant we shall consider more fully
in the chapter that follows; when we note how the power of demons
nearly destroyed Europe and even the heathen health of the world. But
the world's destiny would have been distorted still more fatally if
monotheism had failed in the Mosaic tradition. I hope in a subsequent
section to show that I am not without sympathy with all that health in
the heathen world that made its fairy-tales and its fanciful romances
of religion. But I hope also to show that these were bound to fail in
the long run; and the world would have been lost if it had been unable
to return to that great original simplicity of a single authority in
all things. That we do preserve something of that primary simplicity
that poets and philosophers can still indeed in some sense say an
Universal Prayer, that we live in a large and serene world under a
sky that stretches paternally over all the peoples of the earth, that
philosophy and philanthropy are truisms in a religion of reasonable
men, all that we do most truly owe, under heaven, to a secretive and
restless nomadic people; who bestowed on men the supreme and serene
blessing of a jealous God.

The unique possession was not available or accessible to the pagan
world, because it was also the possession of a jealous people. The Jews
were unpopular, partly because of this narrowness already noted in
the Roman world, partly perhaps because they had already fallen into
that habit of merely handling things for exchange instead of working
to make them with their hands. It was partly also because polytheism
had become a sort of jungle in which solitary monotheism could be
lost; but it is strange to realise how completely it really was lost.
Apart from more disputed matters, there were things in the tradition
of Israel which belong to all humanity now, and might have belonged
to all humanity then. They had one of the colossal corner-stones of
the world: the Book of Job. It obviously stands over against the Iliad
and the Greek tragedies; and even more than they it was an early
meeting and parting of poetry and philosophy in the mornings of the
world. It is a solemn and uplifting sight to see those two eternal
fools, the optimist and the pessimist, destroyed in the dawn of time.
And the philosophy really perfects the pagan tragic irony, precisely
because it is more monotheistic and therefore more mystical. Indeed
the Book of Job avowedly only answers mystery with mystery. Job is
comforted with riddles; but he is comforted. Herein is indeed a type,
in the sense of a prophecy, of things speaking with authority. For
when he who doubts can only say 'I do not understand,' it is true that
he who knows can only reply or repeat 'You do not understand.' And
under that rebuke there is always a sudden hope in the heart; and the
sense of something that would be worth understanding. But this mighty
monotheistic poem remained unremarked by the whole world of antiquity,
which was thronged with polytheistic poetry. It is a sign of the way
in which the Jews stood apart and kept their tradition unshaken and
unshared, that they should have kept a thing like the Book of Job out
of the whole intellectual world of antiquity. It is as if the Egyptians
had modestly concealed the Great Pyramid. But there were other reasons
for a cross-purpose and an impasse, characteristic of the whole of the
end of paganism. After all, the tradition of Israel had only got hold
of one-half of the truth, even if we use the popular paradox and call
it the bigger half. I shall try to sketch in the next chapter that
love of locality and personality that ran through mythology; here it
need only be said that there was a truth in it that could not be let
out though it were a lighter and less essential truth. The sorrow of
Job had to be joined with the sorrow of Hector; and while the former
was the sorrow of the universe the latter was the sorrow of the city;
for Hector could only stand pointing to heaven as the pillar of holy
Troy. When God speaks out of the whirlwind he may well speak in the
wilderness. But the monotheism of the nomad was not enough for all
that varied civilisation of fields and fences and walled cities and
temples and towns; and the turn of these things also was to come, when
the two could be combined in a more definite and domestic religion.
Here and there in all that pagan crowd could be found a philosopher
whose thought ran of pure theism; but he never had, or supposed that
he had, the power to change the customs of the whole populace. Nor is
it easy even in such philosophies to find a true definition of this
deep business of the relation of polytheism and theism. Perhaps the
nearest we can come to striking the note, or giving the thing a name,
is in something far away from all that civilisation and more remote
from Rome than the isolation of Israel. It is in a saying I once heard
from some Hindu tradition; that gods as well as men are only the dreams
of Brahma; and will perish when Brahma wakes. There is indeed in such
an image something of the soul of Asia which is less sane than the
soul of Christendom. We should call it despair, even if they would
call it peace. This note of nihilism can be considered later in a
fuller comparison between Asia and Europe. It is enough to say here
that there is more of disillusion in that idea of a divine awakening
than is implied for us in the passage from mythology to religion.
But the symbol is very subtle and exact in one respect; that it does
suggest the disproportion and even disruption between the very ideas
of mythology and religion, the chasm between the two categories. It is
really the collapse of comparative religion that there is no comparison
between God and the gods. There is no more comparison than there is
between a man and the men who walked about in his dreams. Under the
next heading some attempt will be made to indicate the twilight of that
dream in which the gods walk about like men. But if anyone fancies
the contrast of monotheism and polytheism is only a matter of some
people having one god and others a few more, for him it will be far
nearer the truth to plunge into the elephantine extravagance of Brahmin
cosmology; that he may feel a shudder going through the veil of things,
the many-handed creators, and the throned and haloed animals and all
the network of entangled stars and rulers of the night, as the eyes of
Brahma open like dawn upon the death of all.

V

MAN AND MYTHOLOGIES

What are here called the Gods might almost alternatively be called the
day-dreams. To compare them to dreams is not to deny that dreams can
come true. To compare them to travellers' tales is not to deny that
they may be true tales, or at least truthful tales. In truth they are
the sort of tales the traveller tells to himself. All this mythological
business belongs to the poetical part of men. It seems strangely
forgotten nowadays that a myth is a work of imagination and therefore a
work of art. It needs a poet to make it. It needs a poet to criticise
it. There are more poets than non-poets in the world, as is proved by
the popular origin of such legends. But for some reason I have never
heard explained, it is only the minority of unpoetical people who are
allowed to write critical studies of these popular poems. We do not
submit a sonnet to a mathematician or a song to a calculating boy; but
we do indulge the equally fantastic idea that folk-lore can be treated
as a science. Unless these things are appreciated artistically they are
not appreciated at all. When the professor is told by the Polynesian
that once there was nothing except a great feathered serpent, unless
the learned man feels a thrill and a half temptation to wish it were
true, he is no judge of such things at all. When he is assured, on the
best Red Indian authority, that a primitive hero carried the sun and
moon and stars in a box, unless he clasps his hands and almost kicks
his legs as a child would at such a charming fancy, he knows nothing
about the matter. This test is not nonsensical; primitive children and
barbaric children do laugh and kick like other children; and we must
have a certain simplicity to repicture the childhood of the world. When
Hiawatha was told by his nurse that a warrior threw his grandmother up
to the moon, he laughed like any English child told by his nurse that
a cow jumped over the moon. The child sees the joke as well as most
men, and better than some scientific men. But the ultimate test even
of the fantastic is the appropriateness of the inappropriate. And the
test must appear merely arbitrary because it is merely artistic. If any
student tells me that the infant Hiawatha only laughed out of respect
for tribal custom of sacrificing the aged to economical housekeeping,
I say he did not. If any scholar tells me that the cow jumped over
the moon only because a heifer was sacrificed to Diana, I answer that
it did not. It happened because it is obviously the right thing for
a cow to jump over the moon. Mythology is a lost art, one of the few
arts that really are lost; but it is an art. The horned moon and the
horned mooncalf make a harmonious and almost a quiet pattern. And
throwing your grandmother into the sky is not good behaviour; but it is
perfectly good taste.

Thus scientists seldom understand, as artists understand, that one
branch of the beautiful is the ugly. They seldom allow for the
legitimate liberty of the grotesque. And they will dismiss a savage
myth as merely coarse and clumsy and an evidence of degradation,
because it has not all the beauty of the herald Mercury new lighted on
a heaven-kissing hill; when it really has the beauty of the Mock Turtle
or the Mad Hatter. It is the supreme proof of a man being prosaic that
he always insists on poetry being poetical. Sometimes the humour is
in the very subject as well as the style of the fable. The Australian
aborigines, regarded as the rudest of savages, have a story about a
giant frog who had swallowed the sea and all the waters of the world;
and who was only forced to spill them by being made to laugh. All
the animals with all their antics passed before him and, like Queen
Victoria, he was not amused. He collapsed at last before an eel who
stood delicately balanced on the tip of its tail, doubtless with a
rather desperate dignity. Any amount of fine fantastic literature might
be made out of that fable. There is philosophy in that vision of the
dry world before the beatific Deluge of laughter. There is imagination
in the mountainous monster erupting like an aqueous volcano; there is
plenty of fun in the thought of his goggling visage as the pelican
or the penguin passed by. Anyhow the frog laughed; but the folk-lore
student remains grave.

Moreover, even where the fables are inferior as art, they cannot be
properly judged by science; still less properly judged as science. Some
myths are very crude and queer like the early drawings of children;
but the child is trying to draw. It is none the less an error to treat
his drawing as if it were a diagram, or intended to be a diagram. The
student cannot make a scientific statement about the savage, because
the savage is not making a scientific statement about the world. He
is saying something quite different; what might be called the gossip
of the gods. We may say, if we like, that it is believed before there
is time to examine it. It would be truer to say it is accepted before
there is time to believe it.

I confess I doubt the whole theory of the dissemination of myths or (as
it commonly is) of one myth. It is true that something in our nature
and conditions makes many stories similar; but each of them may be
original. One man does not borrow the story from the other man, though
he may tell it from the same motive as the other man. It would be easy
to apply the whole argument about legend to literature; and turn it
into a vulgar monomania of plagiarism. I would undertake to trace a
notion like that of the Golden Bough through individual modern novels
as easily as through communal and antiquated myths. I would undertake
to find something like a bunch of flowers figuring again and again from
the fatal bouquet of Becky Sharpe to the spray of roses sent by the
Princess of Ruritania. But though these flowers may spring from the
same soil, it is not the same faded flower that is flung from hand to
hand. Those flowers are always fresh.

The true origin of all the myths has been discovered much too
often. There are too many keys to mythology, as there are too many
cryptograms in Shakespeare. Everything is phallic; everything is
totemistic; everything is seed-time and harvest; everything is ghosts
and grave-offerings; everything is the golden bough of sacrifice;
everything is the sun and moon; everything is everything. Every
folk-lore student who knew a little more than his own monomania,
every man of wider reading and critical culture like Andrew Lang, has
practically confessed that the bewilderment of these things left his
brain spinning. Yet the whole trouble comes from a man trying to look
at these stories from the outside, as if they were scientific objects.
He has only to look at them from the inside, and ask himself how he
would begin a story. A story may start with anything and go anywhere.
It may start with a bird without the bird being a totem; it may start
with the sun without being a solar myth. It is said there are only ten
plots in the world; and there will certainly be common and recurrent
elements. Set ten thousand children talking at once, and telling
tarradiddles about what they did in the wood, and it will not be hard
to find parallels suggesting sun-worship or animal worship. Some of
the stories may be pretty and some silly and some perhaps dirty; but
they can only be judged as stories. In the modern dialect, they can
only be judged aesthetically. It is strange that aesthetics, or mere
feeling, which is now allowed to usurp where it has no rights at all,
to wreck reason with pragmatism and morals with anarchy, is apparently
not allowed to give a purely aesthetic judgement on what is obviously a
purely aesthetic question. We may be fanciful about everything except
fairy-tales.

Now the first fact is that the most simple people have the most subtle
ideas. Everybody ought to know that, for everybody has been a child.
Ignorant as a child is, he knows more than he can say and feels not
only atmospheres but fine shades. And in this matter there are several
fine shades. Nobody understands it who has not had what can only be
called the ache of the artist to find some sense and some story in the
beautiful things he sees; his hunger for secrets and his anger at any
tower or tree escaping with its tale untold. He feels that nothing
is perfect unless it is personal. Without that the blind unconscious
beauty of the world stands in its garden like a headless statue. One
need only be a very minor poet to have wrestled with the tower or the
tree until it spoke like a titan or a dryad. It is often said that
pagan mythology was a personification of the powers of nature. The
phrase is true in a sense, but it is very unsatisfactory; because it
implies that the forces are abstractions and the personification is
artificial. Myths are not allegories. Natural powers are not in this
case abstractions. It is not as if there were a God of Gravitation.
There may be a genius of the waterfall; but not of mere falling,
even less than of mere water. The impersonation is not of something
impersonal. The point is that the personality perfects the water with
significance. Father Christmas is not an allegory of snow and holly;
he is not merely the stuff called snow afterwards artificially given a
human form, like a snow man. He is something that gives a new meaning
to the white world and the evergreens, so that snow itself seems to
be warm rather than cold. The test therefore is purely imaginative.
But imaginative does not mean imaginary. It does not follow that it is
all what the moderns call subjective, when they mean false. Every true
artist does feel, consciously or unconsciously, that he is touching
transcendental truths; that his images are shadows of things seen
through the veil. In other words, the natural mystic does know that
there is something there; something behind the clouds or within the
trees; but he believes that the pursuit of beauty is the way to find
it; that imagination is a sort of incantation that can call it up.

Now we do not comprehend this process in ourselves, far less in our
most remote fellow-creatures And the danger of these things being
classified is that they may seem to be comprehended. A really fine
work of folklore, like The Golden Bough, will leave too many readers
with the idea, for instance, that this or that story of a giant's or
wizard's heart in a casket or a cave only 'means' some stupid and
static superstition called 'the external soul.' But we do not know what
these things mean, simply because we do not know what we ourselves mean
when we are moved by them. Suppose somebody in a story says 'Pluck
this flower and a princess will die in a castle beyond the sea,' we
do not know why something stirs in the subconsciousness, or why what
is impossible seems almost inevitable. Suppose we read 'And in the
hour when the king extinguished the candle his ships were wrecked far
away on the coast of Hebrides.' We do not know why the imagination
has accepted that image before the reason can reject it; or why such
correspondences seem really to correspond to something in the soul.
Very deep things in our nature, some dim sense of the dependence of
great things upon small, some dark suggestion that the things nearest
to us stretch far beyond our power, some sacramental feeling of the
magic in material substances, and many more emotions past fading out,
are in an idea like that of the external soul. The power even in the
myths of savages is like the power in the metaphors of poets. The soul
of such a metaphor is often very emphatically an external soul. The
best critics have remarked that in the best poets the simile is often
a picture that seems quite separate from the text. It is as irrelevant
as the remote castle to the flower or the Hebridean coast to the
candle. Shelley compares the skylark to a young woman on a turret, to
a rose embedded in thick foliage, to a series of things that seem to
be about as unlike a skylark in the sky as anything we can imagine.
I suppose the most potent piece of pure magic in English literature
is the much-quoted passage in Keats's Nightingale about the casements
opening on the perilous foam. And nobody notices that the image seems
to come from nowhere; that it appears abruptly after some almost
equally irrelevant remarks about Ruth; and that it has nothing in the
world to do with the subject of the poem. If there is one place in the
world where nobody could reasonably expect to find a nightingale, it
is on a window-sill at the seaside. But it is only in the same sense
that nobody would expect to find a giant's heart in a casket under the
sea. Now, it would be very dangerous to classify the metaphors of the
poets. When Shelley says that the cloud will rise 'like a child from
the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,' it would be quite possible to
call the first a case of the coarse primitive birth-myth and the second
a survival of the ghost-worship which became ancestor-worship. But it
is the wrong way of dealing with a cloud; and is liable to leave the
learned in the condition of Polonius, only too ready to think it like a
weasel, or very like a whale.

Two facts follow from this psychology of day-dreams, which must be
kept in mind throughout their development in mythologies and even
religions. First, these imaginative impressions are often strictly
local. So far from being abstractions turned into allegories, they are
often images almost concentrated into idols. The poet feels the mystery
of a particular forest; not of the science of afforestation or the
department of woods and forests. He worships the peak of a particular
mountain, not the abstract idea of altitude. So we find the god is not
merely water but often one special river; he may be the sea because
the sea is single like a stream; the river that runs round the world.
Ultimately doubtless many deities are enlarged into elements; but they
are something more than omnipresent. Apollo does not merely dwell
wherever the sun shines; his home is on the rock of Delphi. Diana is
great enough to be in three places at once, earth and heaven and hell,
but greater is Diana of the Ephesians. This localised feeling has its
lowest form in the mere fetish or talisman, such as millionaires put on
their motor-cars. But it can also harden into something like a high and
serious religion, where it is connected with high and serious duties;
into the gods of the city or even the gods of the hearth.

The second consequence is this; that in these pagan cults there is
every shade of sincerity--and insincerity. In what sense exactly did
an Athenian really think he had to sacrifice to Pallas Athena? What
scholar is really certain of the answer? In what sense did Dr. Johnson
really think that he had to touch all the posts in the street or that
he had to collect orange-peel? In what sense does a child really think
that he ought to step on every alternate paving-stone? Two things
are at least fairly clear. First, in simpler and less self-conscious
times these forms could become more solid without really becoming more
serious. Day-dreams could be acted in broad daylight, with more liberty
of artistic expression; but still perhaps with something of the light
step of the somnambulist. Wrap Dr. Johnson in an antique mantle, crown
him (by his kind permission) with a garland, and he will move in state
under those ancient skies of morning; touching a series of sacred posts
carved with the heads of the strange terminal gods, that stand at the
limits of the land and of the life of man. Make the child free of the
marbles and mosaics of some classic temples to play on a whole floor
inlaid with squares of black and white; and he will willingly make
this fulfilment of his idle and drifting daydream the clear field for
a grave and graceful dance. But the posts and the paving-stones are
little more and little less real than they are under modern limits.
They are not really much more serious for being taken seriously.
They have the sort of sincerity that they always had; the sincerity
of art as a symbol that expresses very real spiritualities under the
surface of life. But they are only sincere in the same sense as art;
not sincere in the same sense as morality. The eccentric's collection
of orange-peel may turn to oranges in a Mediterranean festival or to
golden apples in a Mediterranean myth. But they are never on the same
plane with the difference between giving the orange to a blind beggar
and carefully placing the orange-peel so that the beggar may fall and
break his leg. Between these two things there is a difference of kind
and not of degree. The child does not think it wrong to step on the
paving-stone as he thinks it wrong to step on the dog's tail. And it
is very certain that whatever jest or sentiment or fancy first set
Johnson touching the wooden posts, he never touched wood with any of
the feeling with which he stretched out his hands to the timber of that
terrible tree, which was the death of God and the life of man.

As already noted, this does not mean that there was no reality or even
no religious sentiment in such a mood. As a matter of fact the Catholic
Church has taken over with uproarious success the whole of this
popular business of giving people local legends and lighter ceremonial
movements. In so far as all this sort of paganism was innocent and in
touch with nature, there is no reason why it should not be patronised
by patron saints as much as by pagan gods. And in any case there are
degrees of seriousness in the most natural make-believe. There is all
the difference between fancying there are fairies in the wood, which
often only means fancying a certain wood as fit for fairies, and
really frightening ourselves until we walk a mile rather than pass
a house we have told ourselves is haunted. Behind all these things
is the fact that beauty and terror are very real things and related
to a real spiritual world; and to touch them at all, even in doubt
or fancy, is to stir the deep things of the soul. We all understand
that and the pagans understood it. The point is that paganism did not
really stir the soul except with these doubts and fancies, with the
consequence that we to-day can have little beyond doubts and fancies
about paganism. All the best critics agree that all the greatest poets,
in pagan Hellas for example, had an attitude towards their gods which
is quite queer and puzzling to men in the Christian era. There seems
to be an admitted conflict between the god and the man; but everybody
seems to be doubtful about which is the hero and which is the villain.
This doubt does not merely apply to a doubter like Euripides in the
Bacchae; it applies to a moderate conservative like Sophocles in the
Antigone; or even to a regular Tory and reactionary like Aristophanes
in the Frogs. Sometimes it would seem that the Greeks believed above
all things in reverence, only they had nobody to revere. But the point
of the puzzle is this, that all this vagueness and variation arise from
the fact that the whole thing began in fancy and in dreaming; and that
there are no rules of architecture for a castle in the clouds.

This is the mighty and branching tree called mythology which ramifies
round the whole world, whose remote branches under separate skies
bear like coloured birds the costly idols of Asia and the half-baked
fetishes of Africa and the fairy kings and princesses of the folk-tales
of the forest, and buried amid vines and olives the Lares of the
Latins, and carried on the clouds of Olympus the buoyant supremacy of
the gods of Greece. These are the myths: and he who has no sympathy
with myths has no sympathy with men. But he who has most sympathy
with myths will most fully realise that they are not and never were a
religion, in the sense that Christianity or even Islam is a religion.
They satisfy some of the needs satisfied by a religion; and notably the
need for doing certain things at certain dates; the need of the twin
ideas of festivity and formality. But though they provide a man with a
calendar they do not provide him with a creed. A man did not stand up
and say 'I believe in Jupiter and Juno and Neptune,' etc., as he stands
up and says 'I believe in God the Father Almighty,' and the rest of
the Apostles Creed. Many believed in some and not in others, or more
in some and less in others, or only in a very vague poetical sense in
any. There was no moment when they were all collected into an orthodox
order which men would fight and be tortured to keep intact. Still less
did anybody ever say in that fashion: 'I believe in Odin and Thor and
Freya,' for outside Olympus even the Olympian order grows cloudy and
chaotic. It seems clear to me that Thor was not a god at all but a
hero. Nothing resembling a religion would picture anybody resembling a
god as groping like a pigmy in a great cavern, that turned out to be
the glove of a giant. That is the glorious ignorance called adventure
Thor may have been a great adventurer; but to call him a god is like
trying to compare Jehovah with Jack and the Beanstalk. Odin seems to
have been a real barbarian chief, possibly of the Dark Ages after
Christianity. Polytheism fades away at its fringes into fairy-tales
or barbaric memories; it is not a thing like monotheism as held by
serious monotheists. Again it does satisfy the need to cry out on some
uplifted name or some noble memory in moments that are themselves noble
and uplifted; such as the birth of a child or the saving of a city.
But the name was so used by many to whom it was only a name. Finally
it did satisfy, or rather it partially satisfied, a thing very deep in
humanity indeed; the idea of surrendering something as the portion of
the unknown powers; of pouring of wine upon the ground, of throwing a
ring into the sea; in a word, of sacrifice. It is the wise and worthy
idea of not taking our advantage to the full; of putting something in
the other balance to ballast our dubious pride, of paying tithes to
nature for our land. This deep truth of the danger of insolence, or
being too big for our boots, runs through all the great Greek tragedies
and makes them great. But it runs side by side with an almost cryptic
agnosticism about the real nature of the gods to be propitiated.
Where that gesture of surrender is most magnificent, as among the
great Greeks, there is really much more idea that the man will be
the better for losing the ox than that the god will be the better
for getting it. It is said that in its grosser forms there are often
actions grotesquely suggestive of the god really eating the sacrifice.
But this fact is falsified by the error that I put first in this note
on mythology. It is misunderstanding the psychology of day-dreams. A
child pretending there is a goblin in a hollow tree will do a crude and
material thing, like leaving a piece of cake for him. A poet might do
a more dignified and elegant thing, like bringing to the god fruits as
well as flowers. But the degree of seriousness in both acts may be the
same or it may vary in almost any degree. The crude fancy is no more
a creed than the ideal fancy is a creed. Certainly the pagan does not
disbelieve like an atheist, any more than he believes like a Christian.
He feels the presence of powers about which he guesses and invents. St.
Paul said that the Greeks had one altar to an unknown god. But in truth
all their gods were unknown gods. And the real break in history did
come when St. Paul declared to them whom they had ignorantly worshipped.

The substance of all such paganism may be summarised thus. It is an
attempt to reach the divine reality through the imagination alone;
in its own field reason does not restrain it at all. It is vital to
view of all history that reason is something separate from religion
even in the most rational of these civilisations. It is only as an
afterthought, when such cults are decadent or on the defensive, that a
few Neo-Platonists or a few Brahmins are found trying to rationalise
them, and even then only by trying to allegorise them. But in reality
the rivers of mythology and philosophy run parallel and do not mingle
till they meet in the sea of Christendom. Simple secularists still talk
as if the Church had introduced a sort of schism between reason and
religion. The truth is that the Church was actually the first thing
that ever tried to combine reason and religion. There had never before
been any such union of the priests and the philosophers. Mythology,
then, sought god through the imagination; or sought truth by means
of beauty, in the sense in which beauty includes much of the most
grotesque ugliness. But the imagination has its own laws and therefore
its own triumphs, which neither logicians nor men of science can
understand It remained true to that imaginative instinct through a
thousand extravagances, through every crude cosmic pantomime of a pig
eating the moon or the world being cut out of a cow, through all the
dizzy convolutions and mystic malformations of Asiatic art, through all
the stark and staring rigidity of Egyptian and Assyrian portraiture,
through every kind of cracked mirror of mad art that seemed to deform
the world and displace the sky, it remained true to something about
which there can be no argument; something that makes it possible
for some artist of some school to stand suddenly still before that
particular deformity and say, 'My dream has come true.' Therefore
do we all in fact feel that pagan or primitive myths are infinitely
suggestive, so long as we are wise enough not to inquire what they
suggest. Therefore we all feel what is meant by Prometheus stealing
fire from heaven, until some prig of a pessimist or progressive person
explains what it means. Therefore we all know the meaning of Jack and
the Beanstalk, until we are told. In this sense it is true that it is
the ignorant who accept myths, but only because it is the ignorant who
appreciate poems. Imagination has its own laws and triumphs; and a
tremendous power began to clothe its images, whether images in the mind
or in the mud, whether in the bamboo of the South Sea Islands or the
marble of the mountains of Hellas. But there was always a trouble in
the triumph, which in these pages I have tried to analyse in vain; but
perhaps I might in conclusion state it thus.

The crux and crisis is that man found it natural to worship; even
natural to worship unnatural things. The posture of the idol might
be stiff and strange; but the gesture of the worshipper was generous
and beautiful. He not only felt freer when he bent; he actually felt
taller when he bowed. Henceforth anything that took away the gesture
of worship would stunt and even maim him for ever. Henceforth being
merely secular would be a servitude and an inhibition. If man cannot
pray he is gagged; if he cannot kneel he is in irons. We therefore
feel throughout the whole of paganism a curious double feeling of
trust and distrust. When the man makes the gesture of salutation and
of sacrifice, when he pours out the libation or lifts up the sword, he
knows he is doing a worthy and a virile thing. He knows he is doing one
of the things for which a man was made. His imaginative experiment is
therefore justified. But precisely because it began with imagination,
there is to the end something of mockery in it, and especially in
the object of it. This mockery, in the more in tense moments of the
intellect, becomes the almost intolerable irony of Greek tragedy. There
seems a disproportion between the priest and the altar or between
the altar and the god. The priest seems more solemn and almost more
sacred than the god. All the order of the temple is solid and sane and
satisfactory to certain parts of our nature; except the very centre of
it, which seems strangely mutable and dubious, like a dancing flame.
It is the first thought round which the whole has been built; and the
first thought is still a fancy and almost a frivolity. In that strange
place of meeting, the man seems more statuesque than the statue.
He himself can stand for ever in the noble and natural attitude of
the statue of the Praying Boy. But whatever name be written on the
pedestal, whether Zeus or Ammon or Apollo, the god whom he worships is
Proteus.

The Praying Boy may be said to express a need rather than to satisfy
a need. It is by a normal and necessary action that his hands are
lifted; but it is no less a parable that his hands are empty. About the
nature of that need there will be more to say; but at this point it
may be said that perhaps after all this true instinct, that player and
sacrifice are a liberty and an enlargement, refers back to that vast
and half-forgotten conception of universal fatherhood, which we have
already seen everywhere fading from the morning sky. This is true; and
yet it is not all the truth. There remains an indestructible instinct,
in the poet as represented by the pagan, that he is not entirely wrong
in localising his God. It is something in the soul of poetry if not of
piety. And the greatest of poets, when he defined the poet, did not
say that he gave us the universe or the absolute or the infinite; but,
in his own larger language, a local habitation and a name. No poet
is merely a pantheist; those who are counted most pantheistic, like
Shelley, start with some local and particular image as the pagans did.
After all, Shelley wrote of the skylark because it was a skylark. You
could not issue an imperial or international translation of it for
use in South America, in which it was changed to an ostrich. So the
mythological imagination moves as it were in circles, hovering either
to find a place or to return to it. In a word, mythology is a search;
it is something that combines a recurrent desire with a recurrent
doubt, mixing a most hungry sincerity in the idea of seeking for a
place with a most dark and deep and mysterious levity about all the
places found. So far could the lonely imagination lead, and we must
turn later to the lonely reason. Nowhere along this road did the two
ever travel together.

That is where all these things differed from religion or the reality in
which these different dimensions met in a sort of solid. They differed
from the reality not in what they looked like but in what they were.
A picture may look like a landscape; it may look in every detail
exactly like a landscape. The only detail in which it differs is that
it is not a landscape. The difference is only that which divides a
portrait of Queen Elizabeth from Queen Elizabeth. Only in this mythical
and mystical world the portrait could exist before the person; and
the portrait was therefore more vague and doubtful. But anybody who
has felt and fed on the atmosphere of these myths will know what I
mean, when I say that in one sense they did not really profess to be
realities. The pagans had dreams about realities; and they would have
been the first to admit, in their own words, that some came through the
gate of ivory and others through the gate of horn. The dreams do indeed
tend to be very vivid dreams when they touch on those tender or tragic
things, which can really make a sleeper awaken with the sense that his
heart has been broken in his sleep. They tend continually to hover over
certain passionate themes of meeting and parting, of a life that ends
in death or a death that is the beginning of life. Demeter wanders
over a stricken world looking for a stolen child; Isis stretches out
her arms over the earth in vain to gather the limbs of Osiris; and
there is lamentation upon the hills for Atys and through the woods for
Adonis. There mingles with all such mourning the mystical and profound
sense that death can be a deliverer and an appeasement; that such death
gives us a divine blood for a renovating river and that all good is
found in gathering the broken body of the god. We may truly call these
foreshadowing; so long as we remember that foreshadowings are shadows.
And the metaphor of a shadow happens to hit very exactly the truth that
is very vital here. For a shadow is a shape; a thing which reproduces
shape but not texture. These things were something like the real thing;
and to say that they were like is to say that they were different.
Saying something is like a dog is another way of saying it is not a
dog; and it is in this sense of identity that a myth is not a man.
Nobody really thought of Isis as a human being, nobody really thought
of Demeter as a historical character, nobody thought of Adonis as the
founder of a Church. There was no idea that any one of them had changed
the world; but rather that their recurrent death and life bore the
sad and beautiful burden of the changelessness of the world. Not one
of them was a revolution, save in the sense of the revolution of the
sun and moon. Their whole meaning is missed if we do not see that they
mean the shadows that we are and the shadows that we pursue. In certain
sacrificial and communal aspects they naturally suggest what sort of a
god might satisfy them; but they do not profess to be satisfied. Anyone
who says they do is a bad judge of poetry.

Those who talk about Pagan Christs have less sympathy with Paganism
than with Christianity. Those who call these cults 'religions,' and
'compare' them with the certitude and challenge of the Church have much
less appreciation than we have of what made heathenism human, or of
why classic literature is still something that hangs in the air like
a song. It is no very human tenderness for the hungry to prove that
hunger is the same as food. It is no very genial understanding of youth
to argue that hope destroys the need for happiness. And it is utterly
unreal to argue that these images in the mind, admired entirely in the
abstract, were even in the same world with a living man and a living
polity that were worshipped because they were concrete. We might as
well say that a boy playing at robbers is the same as a man in his
first day in the trenches; or that boy's first fancies about 'the not
impossible she' are the same as the sacrament of marriage. They are
fundamentally different exactly where they are superficially similar;
we might almost say they are not the same even when they are the same.
They are only different because one is real and the other is not. I do
not mean merely that I myself believe that one is true and the other
is not. I mean that one was never meant to be true in the same sense
as the other. The sense in which it was meant to be true I have tried
to suggest vaguely here, but it is undoubtedly very subtle and almost
indescribable. It is so subtle that the students who profess to put it
up as a rival to our religion miss the whole meaning and purport of
their own study. We know better than the scholars, even those of us who
are no scholars, what was in that hollow cry that went forth over the
dead Adonis and why the Great Mother had a daughter wedded to death. We
have entered more deeply than they into the Eleusinian Mysteries and
have passed a higher grade, where gate within gate guarded the wisdom
of Orpheus. We know the meaning of all the myths. We know the last
secret revealed to the perfect initiate. And it is not the voice of a
priest or a prophet saying 'These things are.' It is the voice of a
dreamer and an idealist crying, 'Why cannot these things be?'

VI

THE DEMONS AND THE PHILOSOPHERS


I have dwelt at some little length on this imaginative sort of
paganism, which has crowded the world with temples and is everywhere
the parent of popular festivity. For the central history of
civilisation, as I see it, consists of two further stages before the
final stage of Christendom. The first was the struggle between this
paganism and something less worthy than itself, and the second the
process by which it grew in itself less worthy. In this very varied
and often very vague polytheism there was a weakness of original sin.
Pagan gods were depicted as tossing men like dice; and indeed they are
loaded dice. About sex especially men are born unbalanced; we might
almost say men are born mad. They scarcely reach sanity till they reach
sanctity. This disproportion dragged down the winged fancies; and
filled the end of paganism with a mere filth and litter of spawning
gods. But the first point to realise is that this sort of paganism had
an early collision with another sort of paganism; and that the issue of
that essentially spiritual struggle really determined the history of
the world. In order to understand it we must pass to a review of the
other kind of paganism. It can be considered much more briefly; indeed
there is a very real sense in which the less that is said about it the
better. If we have called the first sort of mythology the day-dream, we
might very well call the second sort of mythology the nightmare.

Superstition recurs in all ages, and especially in rationalistic
ages. I remember defending the religious tradition against a whole
luncheon table of distinguished agnostics; and before the end of
our conversation every one of them had procured from his pocket, or
exhibited on his watch-chain, some charm or talisman from which he
admitted that he was never separated. I was the only person present
who had neglected to provide himself with a fetish. Superstition
recurs in a rationalist age because it rests on something which, if
not identical with rationalism, is not unconnected with scepticism.
It is at least very closely connected with agnosticism. It rests on
something that is really a very human and intelligible sentiment, like
the local invocations of the numen in popular paganism. But it is an
agnostic sentiment, for it rests on two feelings: first that we do not
really know the laws of the universe; and second that they may be very
different to all we call reason. Such men realise the real truth that
enormous things do often turn upon tiny things. When a whisper comes,
from tradition or what not, that one particular tiny thing is the key
or clue, something deep and not altogether senseless in human nature
tells them that it is not unlikely. This feeling exists in both the
forms of paganism here under consideration. But when we come to the
second form of it, we find it transformed and filled with another and
more terrible spirit.

In dealing with the lighter thing called mythology, I have said little
about the most disputable aspect of it; the extent to which such
invocation of the spirits of the sea or the elements can indeed call
spirits from the vasty deep; or rather, (as the Shakespearean scoffer
put it) whether the spirits come when they are called. I believe that
I am right in thinking that this problem, practical as it sounds, did
not play a dominant part in the poetical business of mythology. But I
think it even more obvious, on the evidence, that things of that sort
have sometimes appeared, even if they were only appearances. But when
we come to the world of superstition, in a more subtle sense, there is
a shade of difference; a deepening and a darkening shade. Doubtless
most popular superstition is as frivolous as any popular mythology. Men
do not believe as a dogma that God would throw a thunderbolt at them
for walking under a ladder; more often they amuse themselves with the
not very laborious exercise of walking round it. There is no more in it
than what I have already adumbrated; a sort of airy agnosticism about
the possibilities of so strange a world. But there is another sort
of superstition that does definitely look for results; what might be
called a realistic superstition. And with that the question of whether
spirits do answer or do appear becomes much more serious. As I have
said, it seems to me pretty certain that they sometimes do; but about
that there is a distinction that has been the beginning of much evil
in the world. Whether it be because the Fall has really brought men
nearer to less desirable neighbours in the spiritual world, or whether
it is merely that the mood of men eager or greedy finds it easier to
imagine evil, I believe that the black magic of witchcraft has been
much more practical and much less poetical than the white magic of
mythology. I fancy the garden of the witch has been kept much more
carefully than the woodland of the nymph. I fancy the evil field has
even been more fruitful than the good. To start with, some impulse,
perhaps a sort of desperate impulse, drove men to the darker powers
when dealing with practical problems. There was a sort of secret and
perverse feeling that the darker powers would really do things; that
they had no nonsense about them. And indeed that popular phase exactly
expresses the point. The gods of mere mythology had a great deal of
nonsense about them. They had a great deal of good nonsense about them;
in the happy and hilarious sense in which we talk of the nonsense of
Jabberwocky or the Land where Jumblies live. But the man consulting a
demon felt as many a man has felt in consulting a detective, especially
a private detective; that it was dirty work but the work would really
be done. A man did not exactly go into the wood to meet a nymph; he
rather went with the hope of meeting a nymph. It was an adventure
rather than an assignation. But the devil really kept his appointments
and even in one sense kept his promises; even if a man sometimes wished
afterwards, like Macbeth, that he had broken them.

In the accounts given us of many rude or savage races we gather that
the cult of demons often came after the cult of deities, and even after
the cult of one single and supreme deity. It may be suspected that in
almost all such places the higher deity is felt to be too far off for
appeal in certain petty matters, and men invoke the spirits because
they are in a more literal sense familiar spirits. But with the idea
of employing the demons who get things done, a new idea appears more
worthy of the demons. It may indeed be truly described as the idea of
being worthy of the demons; of making oneself fit for their fastidious
and exacting society. Superstition of the lighter sort toys with the
idea that some trifle, some small gesture such as throwing the salt,
may touch the hidden spring that works the mysterious machinery of the
world. And there is after all something in the idea of such an Open
Sesame. But with the appeal to lower spirits comes the horrible notion
that the gesture must not only be very small but very low; that it
must be a monkey trick of an utterly ugly and unworthy sort. Sooner
or later a man deliberately sets himself to do the most disgusting
thing he can think of. It is felt that the extreme of evil will extort
a sort of attention or answer from the evil powers under the surface
of the world. This is the meaning of most of the cannibalism in the
world. For most cannibalism is not a primitive or even a bestial
habit. It is artificial and even artistic, a sort of art for art's
sake. Men do not do it because they do not think it horrible; but,
on the contrary, because they do think it horrible. They wish, in
the most literal sense, to sup on horrors. That is why it is often
found that rude races like the Australian natives are not cannibals;
while much more refined and intelligent races, like the New Zealand
Maories, occasionally are. They are refined and intelligent enough
to indulge sometimes in a self-conscious diabolism. But if we could
understand their minds, or even really understand their language, we
should probably find that they were not acting as ignorant, that is as
innocent cannibals. They are not doing it because they do not think it
wrong, but precisely because they do think it wrong. They are acting
like a Parisian decadent at a Black Mass. But the Black Mass has to
hide underground from the presence of the real Mass. In other words,
the demons have really been in hiding since the coming of Christ on
earth. The cannibalism of the higher barbarians is in hiding from the
civilisation of the white man. But before Christendom, and especially
outside Europe, this was not always so. In the ancient world the demons
often wandered abroad like dragons. They could be positively and
publicly enthroned as gods. Their enormous images could be set up in
public temples in the centre of populous cities. And all over the world
the traces can be found of this striking and solid fact, so curiously
overlooked by the moderns who speak of all such evil as primitive and
early in evolution, that as a matter of fact some of the very highest
civilisations of the world were the very places where the horns of
Satan were exalted, not only to the stars but in the face of the
sun. Take for example the Aztecs and American Indians of the ancient
empires of Mexico and Peru. They were at least as elaborate as Egypt
or China and only less lively than that central civilisation which is
our own. But those who criticise that central civilisation (which is
always their own civilisation) have a curious habit of not merely doing
their legitimate duty in condemning its crimes, but of going out of
their way to idealise its victims. They always assume that before the
advent of Europe there was nothing anywhere but Eden. And Swinburne,
in that spirited chorus of the nations in 'Songs before Sunrise,'
used an expression about Spain in her South American conquests which
always struck me as very strange. He said something about 'her sins
and sons through sinless lands dispersed,' and how they 'made accursed
the name of man and thrice accursed the name of God.' It may be
reasonable enough that he should say the Spaniards were sinful, but why
in the world should he say that the South Americans were sinless? Why
should he have supposed that continent to be exclusively populated by
archangels or saints perfect in heaven? It would be a strong thing to
say of the most respectable neighbourhood; but when we come to think of
what we really do know of that society the remark is rather funny. We
know that the sinless priests of this sinless people worshipped sinless
gods, who accepted as the nectar and ambrosia of their sunny paradise
nothing but incessant human sacrifice accompanied by horrible torments.
We may note also in the mythology of this American civilisation that
element of reversal or violence against instinct of which Dante wrote;
which runs backwards everywhere through the unnatural religion of the
demons. It is notable not only in ethics but in aesthetics. A South
American idol was made as ugly as possible, as a Greek image was made
as beautiful as possible. They were seeking the secret of power, by
working backwards against their own nature and the nature of things.
There was always a sort of yearning to carve at last, in gold or
granite or the dark red timber of the forests, a face at which the sky
itself would break like a cracked mirror.

In any case it is clear enough that the painted and gilded civilisation
of tropical America systematically indulged in human sacrifice. It is
by no means clear, so far as I know, that the Eskimos ever indulged in
human sacrifice. They were not civilised enough. They were too closely
imprisoned by the white winter and the endless dark. Chill penury
repressed their noble rage and froze the genial current of the soul.
It was in brighter days and broader daylight that the noble rage is
found unmistakably raging. It was in richer and more instructed lands
that the genial current flowed on the altars, to be drunk by great
gods wearing goggling and grinning masks and called on in terror or
torment by long cacophonous names that sound like laughter in hell. A
warmer climate and a more scientific cultivation were needed to bring
forth these blooms; to draw up towards the sun the large leaves and
flamboyant blossoms that gave their gold and crimson and purple to that
garden, which Swinburne compares to the Hesperides. There was at least
no doubt about the dragon.

I do not raise in this connection the special controversy about Spain
and Mexico; but I may remark in passing that it resembles exactly
the question that must in some sense be raised afterwards about Rome
and Carthage. In both cases there has been a queer habit among the
English of always siding against the Europeans, and representing the
rival civilisation, in Swinburne's phrase, as sinless; when its sins
were obviously crying or rather screaming to heaven. For Carthage
also was a high civilisation, indeed a much more highly civilised
civilisation. And Carthage also founded that civilisation on a religion
of fear, sending up everywhere the smoke of human sacrifice. Now it
is very right to rebuke our own race or religion for falling short of
our own standards and ideals. But it is absurd to pretend that they
fell lower than the other races and religions that professed the very
opposite standards and ideals. There is a very real sense in which the
Christian is worse than the heathen, the Spaniard worse than the Red
Indian, or even the Roman potentially worse than the Carthaginian.
But there is only one sense in which he is worse; and that is not in
being positively worse. The Christian is only worse because it is his
business to be better.

This inverted imagination produces things of which it is better not to
speak. Some of them indeed might almost be named without being known;
for they are of that extreme evil which seems innocent to the innocent.
They are too inhuman even to be indecent. But without dwelling much
longer in these dark corners, it may be noted as not irrelevant here
that certain anti-human antagonisms seem to recur in this tradition of
black magic. There may be suspected as running through it everywhere,
for instance, a mystical hatred of the idea of childhood. People
would understand better the popular fury against the witches, if
they remembered that the malice most commonly attributed to them was
preventing the birth of children. The Hebrew prophets were perpetually
protesting against the Hebrew race relapsing into an idolatry that
involved such a war upon children; and it is probable enough that this
abominable apostasy from the God of Israel has occasionally appeared
in Israel since, in the form of what is called ritual murder; not
of course by any representative of the religion of Judaism, but by
individual and irresponsible diabolists who did happen to be Jews. This
sense that the forces of evil especially threaten childhood is found
again in the enormous popularity of the Child Martyr of the Middle
Ages. Chaucer did but give another version of a very national English
legend, when he conceived the wickedest of all possible witches as the
dark alien woman watching behind her high lattice and heading, like the
babble of a brook down the stony street, the singing of little St. Hugh.

Anyhow the part of such speculations that concerns this story centered
especially round that eastern end of the Mediterranean, where the
nomads had turned gradually into traders and had begun to trade with
the whole world. Indeed in the sense of trade and travel and colonial
extension, it already had something like an empire of the whole world.
Its purple dye, the emblem of its rich pomp and luxury, had steeped the
wares which were sold far away amid the last crags of Cornwall and the
sails that entered the silence of tropic seas amid all the mystery of
Africa. It might be said truly to have painted the map purple. It was
already a world-wide success, when the princes of Tyre would hardly
have troubled to notice that one of their princesses had condescended
to marry the chief of some tribe called Judah; when the merchants of
its African outpost would only have curled their bearded and Semitic
lips with a slight smile at the mention of a village called Rome. And
indeed no two things could have seemed more distant from each other,
not only in space but in Spirit, than the monotheism of the Palestinian
tribe and the very virtues of the small Italian republic. There was but
one thing between them; and the thing which divided them has united
them. Very various and incompatible were the things that could be loved
by the consuls of Rome and the prophets of Israel; but they were at one
in what they hated. It is very easy in both cases to represent that
hatred as something merely hateful. It is easy enough to make a merely
harsh and inhuman figure either of Elijah raving above the slaughter
of Carmel or Cato thundering against the amnesty of Africa. These men
had their limitations and their local passions; but this criticism of
them is unimaginative and therefore unreal. It leaves out something,
something immense and intermediate, facing east and west and calling up
this passion in its eastern and western enemies; and that something is
the first subject of this chapter.

The civilisation that centered in Tyre and Sidon was above all things
practical. It has left little in the way of art and nothing in the
way of poetry. But it prided itself upon being very efficient; and it
followed in its philosophy and religion that strange and sometimes
secret train of thought which we have already noted in those who look
for immediate effects. There is always in such a mentality an idea
that there is a short cut to the secret of all success; something that
would shock the world by this sort of shameless thoroughness. They
believed, in the appropriate modern phrase, in people who delivered the
goods. In their dealings with their god Moloch, they themselves were
always careful to deliver the goods. It was an interesting transaction,
upon which we shall have to touch more than once in the rest of the
narrative; it is enough to say here that it involved the theory I have
suggested, about a certain attitude towards children. This was what
called up against it in simultaneous fury the servant of one God in
Palestine and the guardians of all the household gods in Rome This is
what challenged two things naturally so much divided by every sort of
distance and disunion, whose union was to save the world.

I have called the fourth and final division of the spiritual elements
into which I should divide heathen humanity by the name of The
Philosophers. I confess that it covers in my mind much that would
generally be classified otherwise; and that what are here called
philosophies are very often called religions. I believe however that my
own description will be found to be much the more realistic and not the
less respectful. But we must first take philosophy in its purest and
clearest form that we may trace its normal outline; and that is to be
found in the world of the purest and clearest outlines, that culture of
the Mediterranean of which we have been considering the mythologies and
idolatries in the last two chapters.

Polytheism, or that aspect of paganism, was never to the pagan what
Catholicism is to the Catholic. It was never a view of the universe
satisfying all sides of life; a complete and complex truth with
something to say about everything. It was only a satisfaction of one
side of the soul of man, even if we call it the religious side; and
I think it is truer to call it the imaginative side. But this it did
satisfy; in the end it satisfied it to satiety. All that world was a
tissue of interwoven tales and cults, and there ran in and out of it,
as we have already seen, that black thread among its more blameless
colours; the darker paganism that was really diabolism. But we all know
that this did not mean that all pagan men thought of nothing but pagan
gods. Precisely because mythology only satisfied one mood, they turned
in other moods to something totally different. But it is very important
to realise that it was totally different. It was too different to be
inconsistent. It was so alien that it did not clash. While a mob of
people were pouring on a public holiday to the feast of Adonis or
the games in honour of Apollo, this or that man would prefer to stop
at home and think out a little theory about the nature of things.
Sometimes his hobby would even take the form of thinking about the
nature of God; or even in that sense about the nature of the gods. But
he very seldom thought of pitting his nature of the gods against the
gods of nature.

It is necessary to insist on this abstraction in the first student of
abstractions. He was not so much antagonistic as absent-minded. His
hobby might be the universe; but at first the hobby was as private
as if it had been numismatics or playing draughts. And even when
his wisdom came to be a public possession, and almost a political
situation, it was very seldom on the same plane as the popular and
religious institutions. Aristotle, with his colossal common sense,
was perhaps the greatest of all philosophers; certainly the most
practical of all philosophies But Aristotle would no more have set
up the Absolute side by side with the Apollo of Delphi, as a similar
or rival religion, than Archimedes would have thought of setting
up the lever as a sort of idol or fetish to be substituted for the
Palladium of the city. Or we might as well imagine Euclid building an
altar to an isosceles triangle, or offering sacrifices to the square
of the hypotenuse. The one man meditated on metaphysics as the other
man did on mathematics; for the love of truth or for curiosity or
for the fun of the thing. But that sort of fun never seems to have
interfered very much with the other sort of fun; the fun of dancing
or singing to celebrate some rascally romance about Zeus becoming a
bull or a swan. It is perhaps the proof of a certain superficiality
and even insincerity about the popular polytheism, that men could be
philosophers and even sceptics without disturbing it. These thinkers
could move the foundations of the world without altering even the
outline of that coloured cloud that hung above it in the air.

For the thinkers did move the foundations of the world, even when a
curious compromise seemed to prevent them from moving the foundations
of the city. The two great philosophers of antiquity do indeed appear
to us as defenders of sane and even of sacred ideas; their maxims often
read like the answers to sceptical questions too completely answered
to be always recorded. Aristotle annihilated a hundred anarchists and
nature-worshipping cranks by the fundamental statement that man is a
political animal. Plato in some sense anticipated the Catholic realism,
as attacked by the heretical nominalism, by insisting on the equally
fundamental fact that ideas are realities; that ideas exist just as men
exist. Plato however seemed sometimes almost to fancy that ideas exist
as men do not exist; or that the men need hardly be considered where
they conflict with the ideas. He had something of the social sentiment
that we call Fabian in his ideal of fitting the citizen to the city.
Like an imaginary head to an ideal hat; and great and glorious as he
remains, he has been the Father of all faddists. Aristotle anticipated
more fully the sacramental sanity that was to combine the body and
the soul of things; for he considered the nature of men as well
as the nature of morals, and looked to the eyes as well as to the
light. But though these great men were in that sense constructive and
conservative, they belonged to a world where thought was free to the
point of being fanciful. Many other great intellects did indeed follow
them, some exalting an abstract vision of virtue, others following more
rationalistically the necessity of the human pursuit of happiness. The
former had the name of Stoics; and their name has passed into a proverb
for what is indeed one of the main moral ideals of mankind: that of
strengthening the mind itself until it is of a texture to resist
calamity or even pain. But it is admitted that a great number of the
philosophers degenerated into what we still call sophists. They became
a sort of professional sceptics who went about asking uncomfortable
questions, and were handsomely paid for making themselves a nuisance
to normal people. It was perhaps an accidental resemblance to such
questioning quacks that was responsible for the unpopularity of the
great Socrates; whose death might seem to contradict the suggestion of
the permanent truce between the philosophers and the gods. But Socrates
did not die as a monotheist who denounced polytheism; certainly not
as a prophet who denounced idols. It is clear to anyone reading
between the lines that there was some notion, right or wrong, of a
purely personal influence affecting morals and perhaps politics The
general compromise remained, whether it was that the Greeks thought
their myths a joke or that they thought their theories a joke. There
was never any collision in which one really destroyed the other, and
there was never any combination in which one was really reconciled
with the other. They certainly did not work together; if anything the
philosopher was a rival of the priest. But both seemed to have accepted
a sort of separation of functions and remained parts of the same
social system. Another important tradition descends from Pythagoras;
who is significant because he stands nearest to the Oriental mystics
who must be considered in their turn. He taught a sort of mysticism of
mathematics, that number is the ultimate reality; but he also seems to
have taught the transmigration of souls like the Brahmins; and to have
left to his followers certain traditional tricks of vegetarianism and
water-drinking very common among the eastern sages, especially those
who figure in fashionable drawing-rooms, like those of the later Roman
Empire. But in passing to eastern sages, and the somewhat different
atmosphere of the east, we may approach a rather important truth by
other path.

One of the great philosophers said that it would be well if
philosophers were kings, or kings were philosophers. He spoke as
of something too good to be true; but, as a matter of fact, it not
unfrequently was true. A certain type, perhaps too little noticed in
history, may really be called the royal philosopher. To begin with,
apart from actual royalty, it did occasionally become possible for
the sage, though he was not what we call a religious founder, to be
something like a political founder. And the great example of this,
one of the very greatest in the world, will with the very thought
of it carry us thousands of miles across the vast spaces of Asia to
that very wonderful and in some ways that very wise world of ideas
and institutions, which we dismiss somewhat cheaply when we talk of
China. Men have served many very strange gods; and trusted themselves
loyally to many ideals and even idols. China is a society that
has really chosen to believe in intellect. It has taken intellect
seriously; and it may be that it stands alone in the world. From a
very early age it faced the dilemma of the king and the philosopher by
actually appointing a philosopher to advise the king. It made a public
institution out of a private individual, who had nothing in the world
to do but to be intellectual. It had and has, of course, many other
things on the same pattern. It creates all ranks and privileges by
public examination; it has nothing that we call an aristocracy; it is
a democracy dominated by an intelligensia. But the point here is that
it had philosophers to advise kings; and one of those philosophers must
have been a great philosopher and a great statesman.

Confucius was not a religious founder or even a religious teacher;
possibly not even a religious man. He was not an atheist; he was
apparently what we call an agnostic. But the really vital point is that
it is utterly irrelevant to talk about his religion at all. It is like
talking of theology as the first thing in the story of how Rowland Hill
established the postal system or Baden Powell organised the Boy Scouts.
Confucius was not there to bring a message from heaven to humanity, but
to organise China; and he must have organised it exceedingly well. It
follows that he dealt much with morals; but he bound them up strictly
with manners. The peculiarity of his scheme and of his country, in
which it contrasts with its great pendant the system of Christendom, is
that he insisted on perpetuating an external life with all its forms,
that outward continuity might preserve internal peace. Anyone who knows
how much habit has to do with health, of mind as well as body, will see
the truth in his idea. But he will also see that the ancestor-worship
and the reverence for the Sacred Emperor were habits and not creeds. It
is unfair to the great Confucius to say he was a religious founder. It
is even unfair to him to say he was not a religious founder. It is as
unfair as going out of one's way to say that Jeremy Bentham was not a
Christian martyr.

But there is a class of most interesting cases in which philosophers
were kings, and not merely the friends of kings. The combination is
not accidental. It has a great deal to do with this rather elusive
question of the function of the philosopher. It contains in it some
hint of why philosophy and mythology seldom came to an open rupture.
It was not only because there was something a little frivolous about
the mythology. It was also because there was something a little
supercilious about the philosopher. He despised the myths, but he
also despised the mob; and thought they suited each other. The pagan
philosopher was seldom a man of the people, at any rate in spirit; he
was seldom a democrat and often a bitter critic of democracy. He had
about him an air of aristocratic and humane leisure; and his part was
most easily played by men who happened to be in such a position. It was
very easy and natural for a prince or a prominent person to play at
being as philosophical as Hamlet or Theseus in the Midsummer Night's
Dream. And from very early ages we find ourselves in the presence of
these princely intellectuals. In fact, we find one of them in the very
first recorded ages of the world; sitting on the primeval throne that
looked over ancient Egypt.

The most intense interest of the incident of Akenahten, commonly called
the Heretic Pharaoh, lies in the fact that he was the one example, at
any rate before Christian times, of one of these royal philosophers
who set himself to fight popular mythology in the name of private
philosophy. Most of them assumed the attitude of Marcus Aurelius, who
is in many ways the model of this sort of monarch and sage. Marcus
Aurelius has been blamed for tolerating the pagan amphitheatre or the
Christian martyrdoms. But it was characteristic; for this sort of
man really thought of popular religion just as he thought of popular
circuses. Of him Professor Phillimore has profoundly said 'a great
and good man--and he knew it.' The heretic Pharaoh had a philosophy
more earnest and perhaps more humble. For there is a corollary to the
conception of being too proud to fight. It is that the humble have to
do most of the fighting. Anyhow, the Egyptian prince was simple enough
to take his own philosophy seriously, and alone among such intellectual
princes he affected a sort of coup d'etat; hurling down the high gods
of Egypt with one imperial gesture and lifting up for all men, like a
blazing mirror of monotheistic truth, the disc of the universal sun.
He had other interesting ideas often to be found in such idealists.
In the sense in which we speak of a Little Englander he was a Little
Egypter. In art he was a realist because he was an idealist; for
realism is more impossible than any other ideal. But after all there
falls on him something of the shadow of Marcus Aurelius, stalked by the
shadow of Professor Phillimore. That is the matter with this noble sort
of prince is that he has nowhere quite escaped being something of a
prig. Priggishness is so pungent a smell that it clings amid the faded
spices even to an Egyptian mummy. That was the matter with the heretic
Pharaoh, as with a good many other heretics, was that he probably
never paused to ask himself whether there was anything in the popular
beliefs and tales of people less educated than himself. And, as already
suggested, there was something in them. There was a real human hunger
in all that element of feature and locality, that procession of deities
like enormous pet animals, in that unwearied watching at certain
haunted spots, in all the many wanderings of mythology. Nature may
not have the name of Isis; Isis may not be really looking for Osiris.
But it is true that Nature is really looking for something; Nature is
always looking for the supernatural. Something much more definite was
to satisfy that need; but a dignified monarch with a disc of the sun
did not satisfy it. The royal experiment failed amid a roaring reaction
of popular superstitions, in which the priests rose on the shoulders of
the people and ascended the throne of the kings.

The next great example I shall take of the princely sage is Gautama,
the great Lord Buddha. I know he is not generally classed merely with
the philosophers; but I am more and more convinced from all information
that reaches me, that this is the real interpretation of his immense
importance. He was by far the greatest and the best of these
intellectuals born in the purple. His reaction was perhaps the noblest
and most sincere of all the resultant actions of that combination of
thinkers and of thrones. For his reaction was renunciation. Marcus
Aurelius was content to say, with a refined irony, that even in a
palace life could be lived well. The fierier Egyptian king concluded
that it could be lived even better after a palace revolution. But the
great Gautama was the only one of them who proved he could really
do without his palace. One fell back on toleration and the other on
revolution. But after all there is something more absolute about
abdication. Abdication is perhaps the one really absolute action of
an absolute monarch. The Indian prince, reared in Oriental luxury
and pomp, deliberately went out and lived the life of a beggar. That
is magnificent, but it is not war; that is, it is not necessarily a
Crusade in the Christian sense. It does not decide the question of
whether the life of a beggar was the life of a saint or the life of a
philosopher. It does not decide whether this great man is really to go
into the tub of Diogenes or the cave of St. Jerome. Now those who seem
to be nearest to the study of Buddha, and certainly those who write
most clearly and intelligently about him, convince me for one that he
was simply a philosopher who founded a successful school of philosophy,
and was turned into a sort of divus or sacred being merely by the
more mysterious and unscientific atmosphere of all such traditions in
Asia. So that it is necessary to say at this point a word about that
invisible yet vivid border-line that we cross in passing from the
Mediterranean into the mystery of the East.

Perhaps there are no things out of which we get so little of the truth
as the truisms; especially when they are really true. We are all in
the habit of saying certain things about Asia, which are true enough
but which hardly help us because we do not understand their truth; as
that Asia is old or looks to the past or is not progressive. Now it is
true that Christendom is more progressive, in a sense that has very
little to do with the rather provincial notion of an endless fuss of
political improvement. Christendom does believe, for Christianity does
believe, that man can eventually get somewhere, here or hereafter, or
in various ways according to various doctrines. The world's desire can
somehow be satisfied as desires are satisfied, whether by a new life or
an old love or some form of positive possession and fulfilment. For the
rest, we all know there is a rhythm and not a mere progress in things,
that things rise and fall; only with us the rhythm is a fairly free and
incalculable rhythm. For most of Asia the rhythm has hardened into a
recurrence. It is no longer merely a rather topsy-turvy sort of world;
it is a wheel. What has happened to all those highly intelligent and
highly civilised peoples is that they have been caught up in a sort of
cosmic rotation, of which the hollow hub is really nothing. In that
sense the worst part of existence is that it may just as well go on
like that forever. That is what we really mean when we say that Asia is
old or unprogressive or looking backwards. That is why we see even her
curved swords as arcs broken from that blinding wheel; why we see her
serpentine ornament as returning everywhere, like a snake that is never
slain. It has very little to do with the political varnish of progress;
all Asiatics might have top-hats on their heads but if they had this
spirit still in their hearts, they would only think the hats would
vanish and come round again like the planets; not that running after a
hat could lead them to heaven or even to home.

Now when the genius of Buddha arose to deal with the matter, this sort
of cosmic sentiment was already common to almost everything in the
east. There was indeed the jungle of an extraordinarily extravagant and
almost asphyxiating mythology. Nevertheless it is possible to have more
sympathy with this popular fruitfulness in folk-lore than with some of
the higher pessimism that might have withered it. It must always be
remembered, however, when all fair allowances are made, that a great
deal of spontaneous eastern imagery really is idolatry; the local and
literal worship of an idol. This is probably not true of the ancient
Brahminical system, at least as seen by Brahmins. But that phrase
alone will remind us of a reality of much greater moment. This great
reality is the Caste System of ancient India. It may have had some of
the practical advantages of the Guild System of Medieval Europe. But
it contrasts not only with that Christian democracy, but with every
extreme type of Christian aristocracy, in the fact that it does really
conceive the social superiority as a spiritual superiority. This not
only divides it fundamentally from the fraternity of Christendom,
but leaves it standing like a mighty and terraced mountain of pride
between the relatively egalitarian levels both of Islam and of China.
But the fixity of this formation through thousands of years is another
illustration of that spirit of repetition that has marked time from
time immemorial. Now we may also presume the prevalence of another
idea which we associate with the Buddhists as interpreted by the
Theosophists. As a fact, some of the strictest Buddhists repudiate the
idea and still more scornfully repudiate the Theosophists. But whether
the idea is in Buddhism, or only in the birthplace of Buddhism, or
only in a tradition or a travesty of Buddhism, it is an idea entirely
proper to this principle of recurrence. I mean of course the idea of
Reincarnation.

But Reincarnation is not really a mystical idea. It is not really a
transcendental idea, or in that sense a religious idea. Mysticism
conceives something transcending experience; religion seeks glimpses of
a better good or a worse evil than experience can give. Reincarnation
need only extend experiences in the sense of repeating them. It is
no more transcendental for a man to remember what he did in Babylon
before he was born than to remember what he did in Brixton before he
had a knock on the head. His successive lives need not be any more
than human lives, under whatever limitations burden human life. It has
nothing to do with seeing God or even conjuring up the devil. In other
words, reincarnation as such does not necessarily escape from the wheel
of destiny, in some sense it is the wheel of destiny And whether it
was something that Buddha founded, or something that Buddha found, or
something that Buddha entirely renounced when he found, it is certainly
something having the general character of that Asiatic atmosphere in
which he had to play his part. And the part he played was that of an
intellectual philosopher, with a particular theory about the right
intellectual attitude towards it.

I can understand that Buddhists might resent the view that Buddhism
is merely a philosophy, if we understand by a philosophy merely an
intellectual game such as Greek sophists played, tossing up worlds and
catching them like balls. Perhaps a more exact statement would be that
Buddha was a man who made a metaphysical discipline; which might even
be called a psychological discipline. He proposed a way of escaping
from all this recurrent sorrow; and that was simply by getting rid of
the delusion that is called desire. It was emphatically not that we
should get what we want better by restraining our impatience for part
of it, or that we should get it in a better way or in a better world.
It was emphatically that we should leave off wanting it. If once a man
realised that there is really no reality, that everything, including
his soul, is in dissolution at every instant, he would anticipate
disappointment and be intangible to change, existing (in so far as
he could be said to exist) in a sort of ecstasy of indifference. The
Buddhists call this beatitude and we will not stop our story to argue
the point; certainly to us it is indistinguishable from despair. I do
not see, for instance, why the disappointment of desire should not
apply as much to the most benevolent desires as to the most selfish
ones. Indeed the Lord of Compassion seems to pity people for living
rather than for dying. For the rest, an intelligent Buddhist wrote 'the
explanation of popular Chinese and Japanese Buddhism is that it is not
Buddhism.' That has doubtless ceased to be a mere philosophy, but only
by becoming a mere mythology. One thing is certain; it has never become
anything remotely resembling what we call a Church.

It will appear only a jest to say that all religious history has really
been a pattern of noughts and crosses. But I do not by noughts mean
nothings, but only things that are negative compared with the positive
shape or pattern of the other. And though the symbol is of course only
a coincidence, it is a coincidence that really does coincide. The
mind of Asia can really be represented by a round 0, if not in the
sense of a cypher at least of a circle. The great Asiatic symbol of a
serpent with its tail in its mouth is really a very perfect image of
a certain idea of unity and recurrence that does indeed belong to the
Eastern philosophies and religions. It really is a curve that in one
sense includes everything, and in another sense comes to nothing. In
that sense it does confess, or rather boast, that all argument is an
argument in a circle. And though the figure is but a symbol, we can
see how sound is the symbolic sense that produces it, the parallel
symbol of the Wheel of Buddha generally called the Swastika The cross
is a thing at right angles pointing boldly in opposite directions; but
the Swastika is the same thing in the very act of returning to the
recurrent curve. That crooked cross is in fact a cross turning into a
wheel. Before we dismiss even these symbols as if they were arbitrary
symbols, we must remember how intense was the imaginative instinct that
produced them or selected them both in the east and the west. The cross
has become something more than a historical memory; it does convey,
almost as by a mathematical diagram, the truth about the real point at
issue; the idea of a conflict stretching outwards into eternity. It is
true, and even tautological, to say that the cross is the crux of the
whole matter.

In other words the cross, in fact as well as figure, does really stand
for the idea of breaking out of the circle that is everything and
nothing. It does escape from the circular argument by which everything
begins and ends in the mind. Since we are still dealing in symbols, it
might be put in a parable in the form of that story about St. Francis,
which says that the birds departing with his benediction could wing
their way into the infinites of the four winds of heaven, their tracks
making a vast cross upon the sky; for compared with the freedom of
that flight of birds, the very shape of the Swastika is like a kitten
chasing its tail. In a more popular allegory, we might say that when
St. George thrust his spear into the monster's jaws, he broke in upon
the solitude of the self-devouring serpent and gave it something to
bite besides its own tail. But while many fancies might be used as
figures of the truth, the truth itself is abstract and absolute; though
it is not very easy to sum up except by such figures. Christianity
does appeal to a solid truth outside itself; to something which is in
that sense external as well as eternal. It does declare that things
are really there; or in other words that things are really things--In
this Christianity is at one with common sense; but all religious
history shows that this common sense perishes except where there is
Christianity to preserve it.

It cannot otherwise exist, or at least endure, because mere thought
does not remain sane. In a sense it becomes too simple to be sane. The
temptation of the philosophers is simplicity rather than subtlety. They
are always attracted by insane simplifications, as men poised above
abysses are fascinated by death and nothingness and the empty air. It
needed another kind of philosopher to stand poised upon the pinnacle
of the Temple and keep his balance without casting himself down. One
of these obvious, these too obvious explanations is that everything is
a dream and a delusion and there is nothing outside the ego. Another
is that all things recur; another, which is said to be Buddhist and
is certainly Oriental, is the idea that what is the matter with us
is our creation, in the sense of our coloured differentiation and
personality, and that nothing will be well till we are again melted
into one unity. By this theory, in short, the Creation was the Fall. It
is important historically because it was stored up in the dark heart
of Asia and went forth at various times in various forms over the dim
borders of Europe. Here we can place the mysterious figure of Manes or
Manichaeus, the mystic of inversion, whom we should call a pessimist,
parent of many sects and heresies; here, in a higher place, the figure
of Zoroaster. He has been popularly identified with another of these
too simple explanations; the equality of evil and good, balanced and
battling in every atom. He also is of the school of sages that may be
called mystics; and from the same mysterious Persian garden came upon
ponderous wings Mithras, the unknown god, to trouble the last twilight
of Rome.

That circle or disc of the sun set up in the morning of the world
by the remote Egyptian has been a mirror and a model for all the
philosophers. They have made many things out of it, and sometimes gone
mad about it, especially when as in these eastern sages the circle
became a wheel going round and round in their heads. But the point
about them is that they all think that existence can be represented by
a diagram instead of a drawing; and the rude drawings of the childish
myth-makers are a sort of crude and spirited protest against that
view. They cannot believe that religion is really not a pattern but a
picture. Still less can they believe that it is a picture of something
that really exists outside our minds. Sometimes the philosophy paints
the disc all black and calls himself a pessimist; sometimes he paints
it all white and calls himself an optimist; sometimes he divides it
exactly into halves of black and white and calls himself a dualist,
like those Persian mystics to whom I wish there were space to do
justice. None of them could understand a thing that began to draw
the proportions just as if they were real proportions, disposed in
the living fashion which the mathematical draughtsman would call
disproportionate. Like the first artist in the cave, it revealed to
incredulous eyes the suggestion of a new purpose in what looked like a
wildly crooked pattern; he seemed only to be distorting his diagram,
when he began for the first time in all the ages to trace the lines of
a form--and of a Face.

VII

THE WAR OF THE GODS AND DEMONS

The materialist theory of history, that all politics and ethics are
the expression of economics, is a very simple fallacy indeed. It
consists simply of confusing the necessary conditions of life with
the normal preoccupations of life, that are quite a different thing.
It is like saying that because a man can only walk about on two legs,
therefore he never walks about except to buy shoes and stockings. Man
cannot live without the two props of food and drink, which support
him like two legs; but to suggest that they have been the motives of
all his movements in history is like saying that the goal of all his
military marches or religious pilgrimages must have been the Golden
Leg of Miss Kilmansegg or the ideal and perfect leg of Sir Willoughby
Patterne. But it is such movements that make up the story of mankind
and without them there would practically be no story at all. Cows may
be purely economic, in the sense that we cannot see that they do much
beyond grazing and seeking better grazing grounds; and that is why a
history of cows in twelve volumes would not be very lively reading.
Sheep and goats may be pure economists in their external action at
least; but that is why the sheep has hardly been a hero of epic wars
and empires thought worthy of detailed narration; and even the more
active quadruped has not inspired a book for boys called Golden Deeds
of Gallant Goats or any similar title. But so far from the movements
that make up the story of man being economic, we may say that the
story only begins where the motive of the cows and sheep leaves off.
It will be hard to maintain that the Crusaders went from their homes
into a howling wilderness because cows go from a wilderness to a more
comfortable grazing-grounds. It will be hard to maintain that the
Arctic explorers went north with the same material motive that made the
swallows go south. And if you leave things like all the religious wars
and all the merely adventurous explorations out of the human story,
it will not only cease to be human at all but cease to be a story at
all. The outline of history is made of these decisive curves and angles
determined by the will of man. Economic history would not even be
history.

But there is a deeper fallacy besides this obvious fact; that men
need not live for food merely because they cannot live without food
The truth is that the thing most present to the mind of man is not
the economic machinery necessary to his existence; but rather that
existence itself; the world which he sees when he wakes every morning
and the nature of his general position in it. There is something that
is nearer to him than livelihood, and that is life. For once that he
remembers exactly what work produces his wages and exactly what wages
produce his meals, he reflects ten times that it is a fine day or it
is a queer world, or wonders whether life is worth living, or wonders
whether marriage is a failure, or is pleased and puzzled with his own
children, or remembers his own youth, or in any such fashion vaguely
reviews the mysterious lot of man. This is true of the majority even
of the wage-slaves of our morbid modern industrialism, which by its
hideousness and in-humanity has really forced the economic issue to
the front. It is immeasurably more true of the multitude of peasants
or hunters or fishers who make up the real mass of mankind. Even those
dry pedants who think that ethics depend on economics must admit that
economics depend on existence. And any number of normal doubts and
day-dreams are about existence; not about how we can live, but about
why we do. And the proof of it is simple; as simple as suicide. Turn
the universe upside down in the mind and you turn all the political
economists upside down with it. Suppose that a man wishes to die, and
the professor of political economy becomes rather a bore with his
elaborate explanations of how he is to live. And all the departures and
decisions that make our human past into a story have this character of
diverting the direct course of pure economics. As the economist may
be excused from calculating the future salary of a suicide, so he may
be excused from providing an old age pension for a martyr. As he need
not provide for the future of a martyr so he need not provide for the
family of a monk. His plan is modified in lesser and varying degrees by
a man being a soldier and dying for his own country, by a man being a
peasant and specially loving his own land, by a man being more or less
affected by any religion that forbids or allows him to do this or that.
But all these come back not to an economic calculation about livelihood
but to an elemental outlook upon life. They all come back to what a man
fundamentally feels, when he looks forth from those strange windows
which we call the eyes, upon that strange vision that we call the world.

No wise man will wish to bring more long words into the world. But it
may be allowable to say that we need a new thing; which may be called
psychological history. I mean the consideration of what things meant
in the mind of a man, especially an ordinary man; as distinct from
what is defined or deduced merely from official forms or political
pronouncements. I have already touched on it in such a case as the
totem or indeed any other popular myth. It is not enough to be told
that a tom-cat was called a totem; especially when it was not called
a totem. We want to know what it felt like. Was it like Whittington's
cat or like a witch's cat? Was its real name Pashtl or Puss-in-Boots?
That is the sort of thing we need touching the nature of political
and social relations. We want to know the real sentiment that was the
social bond of many common men, as sane and as selfish as we are. What
did soldiers feel when they saw splendid in the sky that strange totem
that we call the Golden Eagle of the Legions? What did vassals feel
about those other totems the lions or the leopards upon the shield of
their lord? So long as we neglect this subjective side of history,
which may more simply be called the inside of history, there will
always be a certain limitation on that science which can be better
transcended by art. So long as the historian cannot do that, fiction
will be truer than fact. There will be more reality in a novel; yes,
even in a historical novel.

In nothing is this new history needed so much as in the psychology of
war. Our history is stiff with official documents, public or private,
which tell us nothing of the thing itself. At the worst we only have
the official posters, which could not have been spontaneous precisely
because they were official. At the best we have only the secret
diplomacy, which could not have been popular precisely because it was
secret. Upon one or other of these is based the historical judgement
about the real reasons that sustained the struggle. Governments fight
for colonies or commercial rights; governments fight about harbours or
high tariffs; governments fight for a gold mine or a pearl fishery.
It seems sufficient to answer that governments do not fight at all.
Why do the fighters fight? What is the psychology that sustains the
terrible and wonderful thing called a war? Nobody who knows anything
of soldiers believes the silly notion of the dons, that millions of
men can be ruled by force. If they were all to slack, it would be
impossible to punish all the slackers And the least little touch of
slacking would lose a whole campaign in half a day. What did men really
feel about the policy? If it be said that they accepted the policy from
the politician, what did they feel about the politician? If the vassals
warred blindly for their prince what did those blind men see in their
prince?

There is something we all know which can only be rendered, in an
appropriate language, as realpolitik. As a matter of fact, it is an
almost insanely unreal politik. It is always stubbornly and stupidly
repeating that men fight for material ends, without reflecting for a
moment that the material ends are hardly ever material to the men who
fight. In any case no man will die for practical politics, just as no
man will die for pay. Nero could not hire a hundred Christians to be
eaten by lions at a shilling an hour; for men will not be martyred
for money. But the vision called up by real politik, or realistic
politics, is beyond example crazy and incredible. Does anybody in the
world believe that d soldier says, 'My leg is nearly dropping off,
but I shall go on till it drops; for after all I shall enjoy all the
advantages of my government obtaining a warm-water port in the Gulf of
Finland.' Can anybody suppose that a clerk turned conscript says, 'If
I am gassed I shall probably die in torments, but it is a comfort to
reflect that should I ever decide to become a pearl-diver in the South
Seas, that career is now open to me and my countrymen.' Materialist
history is the most madly incredible of all histories, or even of
all romances. Whatever starts wars, the thing that sustains wars is
something in the soul; that is something akin to religion. It is what
men feel about life and about death. A man near to death is dealing
directly with an absolute; it is nonsense to say he is concerned only
with relative and remote complications that death in any case will end.
If he is sustained by certain loyalties, they must be loyalties as
simple as death. They are generally two ideas, which are only two sides
of one idea. The first is the love of something said to be threatened,
if it be only vaguely known as home; the second is dislike and defiance
of some strange thing that threatens it. The first is far more
philosophical than it sounds, though we need not discuss it here. A
man does not want his national home destroyed or even changed, because
he cannot even remember all the good things that go with it; just as
he does not want his house burnt down, because he can hardly count all
the things he would miss. Therefore he fights for what sounds like a
hazy abstraction, but is really a house. But the negative side of it is
quite as noble as well as quite as strong. Men fight hardest when they
feel that the foe is at once an old enemy and an eternal stranger, that
his atmosphere is alien and antagonistic, as the French feel about the
Prussian or the Eastern Christians about the Turk. If we say it is a
difference of religion, people will drift into dreary bickerings about
sects and dogmas. We will pity them and say it is a difference about
death and daylight; a difference that does really come like a dark
shadow between our eyes and the day. Men can think of this difference
even at the point of death; for it is a difference about the meaning of
life.

Men are moved in these things by something far higher and holier than
policy; by hatred. When men hung on in the darkest days of the Great
War, suffering either in their bodies or in their souls for those they
loved, they were long past caring about details of diplomatic objects
as motives for their refusal to surrender. Of myself and those I knew
best I can answer for the vision that made surrender impossible. It was
the vision of the German Emperor's face as he rode into Paris. This
is not the sentiment which some of my idealistic friends describe as
Love. I am quite content to call it hatred; the hatred of hell and all
its works, and to agree that as they do not believe in hell they need
not believe in hatred. But in the face of this prevalent prejudice,
this long introduction has been unfortunately necessary, to ensure an
understanding of what is meant by a religious war. There is a religious
war when two worlds meet; that is when two visions of the world meet;
or in more modern language when two moral atmospheres meet. What is
the one man's breath is the other man's poison; and it is vain to talk
of giving a pestilence a place in the sun. And this is what we must
understand, even at the expense of digression, if we would see what
really happened in the Mediterranean; when right athwart the rising
of the Republic on the Tiber, a thing overtopping and disdaining it,
dark with all the riddles of Asia and trailing all the tribes and
dependencies of imperialism, came Carthage riding on the sea.

The ancient religion of Italy was on the whole that mixture which we
have considered under the head of mythology; save that where the Greeks
had a natural turn for the mythology, the Latins seem to have had a
real turn for religion. Both multiplied gods, yet they sometimes seem
to have multiplied them for almost opposite reasons. It would seem
sometimes as if the Greek polytheism branched and blossomed upwards
like the boughs of a tree, while the Italian polytheism ramified
downward like the roots. Perhaps it would be truer to say that the
former branches lifted themselves lightly, bearing flowers; while
the latter hung down, being heavy with fruit. I mean that the Latins
seem to multiply gods to bring them nearer to men, while the Greek
gods rose and radiated outwards into the morning sky. What strikes
us in the Italian cults is their local and especially their domestic
character. We gain the impression of divinities swarming about the
house like flies; of deities clustering and clinging like bats about
the pillars or building like birds under the eaves. We have a vision
of a god of roofs and a god of gate-posts, of a god of doors and even
a god of drains. It has been suggested that all mythology was a sort
of fairy-tale; but this was a particular sort of fairy-tale which may
truly be called a fireside tale, or a nursery-tale; because it was a
tale of the interior of the home; like those which make chairs and
tables talk like elves. The old household gods of the Italian peasants
seem to have been great, clumsy, wooden images, more featureless than
the figure-head which Quilp battered with the poker. This religion
of the home was very homely. Of course there were other less human
elements in the tangle of Italian mythology. There were Greek deities
superimposed on the Roman; there were here and there uglier things
underneath, experiments in the cruel kind of paganism, like the Arician
rite of the priest slaying the slayer. But these things were always
potential in paganism; they are certainly not the peculiar character
of Latin paganism. The peculiarity of that may be roughly covered
by saying that if mythology personified the forces of nature, this
mythology personified nature as transformed by the forces of man. It
was the god of the corn and not of the grass, of the cattle and not the
wild things of the forest; in short the cult was literally a culture;
as when we speak of it as agriculture.

With this there was a paradox which is still for many the puzzle or
riddle of the Latins. With religion running through every domestic
detail like a climbing plant, there went what seems to many the very
opposite spirit; the spirit of revolt. Imperialists and reactionaries
often involve Rome as the very model of order and obedience; but Rome
was the very reverse. The real history of ancient Rome is much more
like the history of modern Paris. It might be called in modern language
a city built out of barricades. It is said that the gate of Janus was
never closed because there was an eternal war without; it is almost
as true that there was an eternal revolution within. From the first
Plebeian riots to the last Servile Wars, the state that imposed peace
on the world was never really at peace. The rulers were themselves
rebels.

There is a real relation between this religion in private and this
revolution in public life. Stories none the less heroic for being
hackneyed remind us that the Republic was founded on a tyrannicide
that avenged an insult to a wife; that the Tribunes of the people were
re-established after another which avenged an insult to a daughter.
The truth is that only men to whom the family is sacred will ever
have a standard or a status by which to criticise the state. They
alone can appeal to something more holy than the gods of the city; the
gods of the hearth. That is why men are mystified in seeing that the
same nations that are thought rigid in domesticity are also thought
restless in politics, for instance the Irish and the French. It is
worth while to dwell on this domestic point because it is an exact
example of what is meant here by the inside of history, like the inside
of houses. Merely political histories of Rome may be right enough
in saying that this or that was a cynical or cruel act of the Roman
politicians; but the spirit that lifted Rome from beneath was the
spirit of all the Romans; and it is not a cant to call it the ideal of
Cincinnatus passing from the senate to the plough. Men of that sort had
strengthened their village on every side, had extended its victories
already over Italians and even over Greeks, when they found themselves
confronted with a war that changed the world. I have called it here the
war of the gods and demons.

There was established on the opposite coast of the inland sea a city
that bore the name of the New Town. It was already much older, more
powerful, and more prosperous than the Italian town; but there still
remained about it an atmosphere that made the name not inappropriate.
It had been called new because it was a colony like New York or New
Zealand. It was an outpost or settlement of the energy and expansion
of the great commercial cities of Tyre and Sidon. There was a note of
the new countries and colonies about it, a confident and commercial
outlook. It was fond of saying things that rang with a certain metallic
assurance; as that nobody could wash his hands in the sea without the
leave of the New Town. For it depended almost entirely on the greatness
of its ships, as did the two great ports and markets from which its
people came. It brought from Tyre and Sidon a prodigious talent for
trade and considerable experience of travel. It brought other things as
well.

In a previous chapter I have hinted at something of the psychology that
lies behind a certain type of religion. There was a tendency in those
hungry for practical results, apart from poetical results, to call upon
spirits of terror and compulsion; to move Acheron in despair of bending
the Gods. There is always a sort of dim idea that these darker powers
will really do things, with no nonsense about it. In the interior
psychology of the Punic peoples this strange sort of pessimistic
practicality had grown to great proportions. In the New Town, which the
Romans called Carthage, as in the parent cities of Phoenicia, the god
who got things done bore the name of Moloch, who was perhaps identical
with the other deity whom we know as Baal, the Lord. The Romans did
not at first quite know what to call him or what to make of him; they
had to go back to the grossest myth of Greek or Roman origins and
compare him to Saturn devouring his children. But the worshippers of
Moloch were not gross or primitive. They were members of a mature and
polished civilisation, abounding in refinements and luxuries; they were
probably far more civilised than the Romans. And Moloch was not a myth;
or at any rate his meal was not a myth. These highly civilised people
really met together to invoke the blessing of heaven on their empire by
throwing hundreds of their infants into a large furnace. We can only
realise the combination by imagining a number of Manchester merchants
with chimney-pot hats and mutton-chop whiskers, going to church every
Sunday at eleven o'clock to see a baby roasted alive.

The first stages of the political or commercial quarrel can be followed
in far too much detail, precisely because it is merely political or
commercial. The Punic Wars looked at one time as if they would never
end; and it is not easy to say when they ever began. The Greeks and
the Sicilians had already been fighting vaguely on the European side
against the African city. Carthage had defeated Greece and conquered
Sicily. Carthage had also planted herself firmly in Spain; and between
Spain and Sicily the Latin city was contained and would have been
crushed; if the Romans had been of the sort to be easily crushed. Yet
the interest of the story really consists in the fact that Rome was
crushed. If there had not been certain moral elements as well as the
material elements, the story would have ended where Carthage certainly
thought it had ended. It is common enough to blame Rome for not making
peace. But it was a true popular instinct that there could be no peace
with that sort of people It is common enough to blame the Roman for his
Delenda est Carthago; Carthage must be destroyed. It is commoner to
forget that, to all appearance, Rome itself was destroyed. The sacred
savour that hung round Rome for ever, it is too often forgotten, clung
to her partly because she had risen suddenly from the dead. Carthage
was an aristocracy, as are most of such mercantile states. The pressure
of the rich on the poor was impersonal as well as irresistible. For
such aristocracies never permit personal government, which is perhaps
why this one was jealous of personal talent. But genius can turn up
anywhere, even in a governing class. As if to make the world's supreme
test as terrible as possible, it was ordained that one of the great
houses of Carthage should produce a man who came out of those gilded
palaces with all the energy and originality of Napoleon coming from
nowhere. At the worst crisis of the war Rome learned that Italy itself,
by a military miracle, was invaded from the north. Hannibal, the Grace
of Baal as his name ran in his own tongue, had dragged a ponderous
chain of armaments over the starry solitudes of the Alps; and pointed
southward to the city which he had been pledged by all his dreadful
gods to destroy.

Hannibal marched down the road to Rome, and the Romans who rushed to
war with him felt as if they were fighting with a magician. Two great
armies sank to right and left of him into the swamps of the Trebia;
more and more were sucked into the horrible whirlpool of Cannae; more
and more went forth only to fall in ruin at his touch. The supreme sign
of all disasters, which is treason, turned tribe after tribe against
the falling cause of Rome, and still the unconquerable enemy rolled
nearer and nearer to the city; and following their great leader the
swelling cosmopolitan army of Carthage passed like a pageant of the
whole world; the elephants shaking the earth like marching mountains
and the gigantic Gauls with their barbaric panoply and the dark
Spaniards girt in gold and the brown Numidians on their unbridled
desert horses wheeling and darting like hawks, and whole mobs of
deserters and mercenaries and miscellaneous peoples; and the grace of
Baal went before them.

The Roman augurs and scribes who said in that hour that it brought
forth unearthly prodigies, that a child was born with the head of
an elephant or that stars fell down like hailstones, had a far more
philosophical grasp of what had really happened than the modern
historian who can see nothing in it but a success of strategy
concluding a rivalry in commerce. Something far different was felt at
the time and on the spot, as it is always felt by those who experience
a foreign atmosphere entering their own like a fog or a foul savour.
It was no mere military defeat, it was certainly no mere mercantile
rivalry, that filled the Roman imagination with such hideous omens of
nature herself becoming unnatural. It was Moloch upon the mountain of
the Latins, looking with his appalling face across the plain; it was
Baal who trampled the vineyards with his feet of stone; it was the
voice of Tanit the invisible, behind her trailing veils, whispering
of the love that is more horrible than hate. The burning of the
Italian cornfields, the ruin of the Italian vines, were some thing
more than actual; they were allegorical. They were the destruction of
domestic and fruitful things, the withering of what was human before
that inhumanity that is far beyond the human thing called cruelty.
The household gods bowed low in darkness under their lowly roofs; and
above them went the demons upon a wind from beyond all walls, blowing
the trumpet of the Tramontane. The door of the Alps was broken down;
and in no vulgar but a very solemn sense, it was Hell let loose. The
war of the gods and demons seemed already to have ended; and the gods
were dead. The eagles were lost, the legions were broken; and in Rome
nothing remained but honour and the cold courage of despair.

In the whole world one thing still threatened Carthage, and that was
Carthage. There still remained the inner working of an element strong
in all successful commercial states, and the presence of a spirit that
we know. There was still the solid sense and shrewdness of the men
who manage big enterprises; there was still the advice of the best
financial experts; there was still business government; there was still
the broad and sane outlook of practical men of affairs, and in these
things could the Romans hope. As the war trailed on to what seemed
its tragic end, there grew gradually a faint and strange possibility
that even now they might not hope in vain. The plain business men of
Carthage, thinking as such men do in terms of living and dying races,
saw clearly that Rome was not only dying but dead The war was over; it
was obviously hopeless for the Italian city to resist any longer, and
inconceivable that anybody should resist when it was hopeless. Under
these circumstances, another set of broad, sound business principles
remained to be considered. Wars were waged with money, and consequently
cost money; perhaps they felt in their hearts, as do so many of their
kind, that after all war must be a little wicked because it costs
money. The time had now come for peace; and still more for economy. The
messages sent by Hannibal from time to time asking for reinforcements
were a ridiculous anachronism; there were much more important things to
attend to now. It might be true that some consul or other had made a
last dash to the Metaurus, had killed Hannibal's brother and flung his
head, with Latin fury, into Hannibal's camp; and mad actions of that
sort showed how utterly hopeless the Latins felt about their cause. But
even excitable Latins could not be so mad as to cling to a lost cause
for ever. So argued the best financial experts; and tossed aside more
and more letters, full of rather queer alarmist reports. So argued and
acted the great Carthaginian Empire. That meaningless prejudice, the
curse of commercial states, that stupidity is in some way practical and
that genius is in some way futile, led them to starve and abandon that
great artist in the school of arms, whom the gods had given them in
vain.

Why do men entertain this queer idea that what is sordid must always
overthrow what is magnanimous; that there is some dim connection
between brains and brutality, or that it does not matter if a man is
dull so long as he is also mean? Why do they vaguely think of all
chivalry as sentiment and all sentiment as weakness? They do it because
they are, like all men, primarily inspired by religion. For them, as
for all men, the first fact is their notion of the nature of things;
their idea about what world they are living in. And it is their faith
that the only ultimate thing is fear and therefore that the very heart
of the world is evil. They believe that death is stronger than life,
and therefore dead things must be stronger than living things; whether
those dead things are gold and iron and machinery or rocks and rivers
and forces of nature. It may sound fanciful to say that men we meet at
tea-tables or talk to at garden-parties are secretly worshippers of
Baal or Moloch. But this sort of commercial mind has its own cosmic
vision and it is the vision of Carthage. It has in it the brutal
blunder that was the ruin of Carthage. The Punic power fell because
there is in this materialism a mad indifference to real thought. By
disbelieving in the soul, it comes to disbelieving in the mind. Being
too practical to be moral, it denies what every practical soldier
calls the moral of an army. It fancies that money will fight when men
will no longer fight. So it was with the Punic merchant princes. Their
religion was a religion of despair, even when their practical fortunes
were hopeful. How could they understand that the Romans could hope even
when their fortunes were hopeless? Their religion was a religion of
force and fear; how could they understand that men can still despise
fear even when they submit to force? Their philosophy of the world had
weariness in its very heart; above all they were weary of warfare; how
should they understand those who still wage war even when they are
weary of it? In a word, how should they understand the mind of Man, who
had so long bowed down before mindless things, money and brute force
and gods who had the hearts of beasts? They awoke suddenly to the news
that the embers they had disdained too much even to tread out were
again breaking everywhere into flames; that Hasdrubal was defeated,
that Hannibal was outnumbered, that Scipio had carried the war into
Spain; that he had carried it into Africa. Before the very gates of
the golden city Hannibal fought his last fight for it and lost; and
Carthage fell as nothing has fallen since Satan. The name of the New
City remains only as a name. There is no stone of it left upon the
sand. Another war was indeed waged before the final destruction: but
the destruction was final. Only men digging in its deep foundation
centuries after found a heap of hundreds of little skeletons, the holy
relics of that religion. For Carthage fell because she was faithful to
her own philosophy and had followed out to its logical conclusion her
own vision of the universe. Moloch had eaten his children.

The gods had risen again, and the demons had been defeated after all.
But they had been defeated by the defeated, and almost defeated by
the dead. Nobody understands the romance of Rome, and why she rose
afterwards to a representative leadership that seemed almost fated and
fundamentally natural. Who does not keep in mind the agony of horror
and humiliation through which she had continued to testify to the
sanity that is the soul of Europe? She came to stand alone in the midst
of an empire because she had once stood alone in the midst of a ruin
and a waste. After that all men knew in their hearts that she had been
representative of mankind, even when she was rejected of men. And there
fell on her the shadow from a shining and as yet invisible light and
the burden of things to be. It is not for us to guess in what manner
or moment the mercy of God might in any case have rescued the world;
but it is certain that the struggle which established Christendom
would have been very different if there had been an empire of Carthage
instead of an empire of Rome. We have to thank the patience of the
Punic wars if, in after ages, divine things descended at least upon
human things and not inhuman. Europe evolved into its own vices and
its own impotence, as will be suggested on another page; but the worst
into which it evolved was not like what it had escaped. Can any man in
his senses compare the great wooden doll, whom the children expected to
eat a little bit of the dinner, with the great idol who would have been
expected to eat the children? That is the measure of how far the world
went astray, compared with how far it might have gone astray. If the
Romans were ruthless, it was in a true sense to an enemy, and certainly
not merely a rival. They remembered not trade routes and regulations,
but the faces of sneering men; and hated the hateful soul of Carthage.
And we owe them something if we never needed to cut down the groves
of Venus exactly as men cut down the groves of Baal. We owe it partly
to their harshness that our thoughts of our human past are not wholly
harsh. If the passage from heathenry to Christianity was a bridge as
well as a breach, we owe it to those who kept that heathenry human. If,
after all these ages, we are in some sense at peace with paganism, and
can think more kindly of our fathers, it is well to remember the things
that were and the things that might have been. For this reason alone we
can take lightly the load of antiquity and need not shudder at a nymph
on a fountain or a cupid on a valentine. Laughter and sadness link us
with things long past away and remembered without dishonour; and we can
see not altogether without tenderness the twilight sinking around the
Sabine farm and hear the household gods rejoice when Catullus comes
home to Sirmio. Deleta est Carthago.

VIII

THE END OF THE WORLD

I was once sitting on a summer day in a meadow in Kent under the shadow
of a little village church, with a rather curious companion with whom
I had just been walking through the woods. He was one of a group of
eccentrics I had come across in my wanderings who had a new religion
called Higher Thought; in which I had been so far initiated as to
realise a general atmosphere of loftiness or height, and was hoping
at some later and more esoteric stage to discover the beginnings of
thought. My companion was the most amusing of them, for however he may
have stood towards thought, he was at least very much their superior
in experience, having travelled beyond the tropics while they were
meditating in the suburbs; though he had been charged with excess in
telling travellers' tales. In spite of anything said against him, I
preferred him to his companions and willingly went with him through
the wood; where I could not but feel that his sunburnt face and fierce
tufted eyebrows and pointed beard gave him something of the look of
Pan. Then we sat down in the meadow and gazed idly at the tree-tops
and the spire of the village church; while the warm afternoon began to
mellow into early evening and the song of a speck of a bird was faint
far up in the sky and no more than a whisper of breeze soothed rather
than stirred the ancient orchards of the garden of England. Then my
companion said to me: 'Do you know why the spire of that church goes
up like that, I expressed a respectable agnosticism, and he answered
in an off-hand way, 'Oh, the same as the obelisks; the Phallic Worship
of antiquity.' Then I looked across at him suddenly as he lay there
leering above his goatlike beard; and for the moment I thought he
was not Pan but the Devil. No mortal words can express the immense,
the insane incongruity and unnatural perversion of thought involved
in saying such a thing at such a moment and in such a place. For one
moment I was in the mood in which men burned witches; and then a sense
of absurdity equally enormous seemed to open about me like a dawn.
'Why, of course,' I said after a moment's reflection, 'if it hadn't
been for phallic worship, they would have built the spire pointing
downwards and standing on its own apex.' I could have sat in that field
and laughed for an hour. My friend did not seem offended, for indeed
he was never thin-skinned about his scientific discoveries. I had only
met him by chance and I never met him again, and I believe he is now
dead; but though it has nothing to do with the argument, it may be
worth while to mention the name of this adherent of Higher Thought and
interpreter of primitive religious origins; or at any rate the name by
which he was known. It was Louis de Rougemont.

That insane image of the Kentish church standing on the point of its
spire, as in some old rustic, topsy-turvy tale, always comes back into
my imagination when I hear these things said about pagan origins; and
calls to my aid the laughter of the giants. Then I feel as genially
and charitably to all other scientific investigators, higher critics,
and authorities on ancient and modern religion, as I do to poor Louis
de Rougemont. But the memory of that immense absurdity remains as
a sort of measure and check by which to keep sane, not only on the
subject of Christian churches, but also on the subject of heathen
temples. Now a great many people have talked about heathen origins as
the distinguished traveller talked about Christian origins. Indeed a
great many modern heathens have been very hard on heathenism. A great
many modern humanitarians have been very hard on the real religion of
humanity. They have represented it as being everywhere and from the
first rooted only in these repulsive arcana; and carrying the character
of something utterly shameless and anarchical. Now I do not believe
this for a moment. I should never dream of thinking about the whole
worship of Apollo what De Rougemont could think about the worship of
Christ. I would never admit that there was such an atmosphere in a
Greek city as that madman was able to smell in a Kentish village. On
the contrary, it is the whole point, even of this final chapter upon
the final decay of paganism, to insist once more that the worst sort
of paganism had already been defeated by the best sort. It was the
best sort of paganism that conquered the gold of Carthage. It was the
best sort of paganism that wore the laurels of Rome. It was the best
thing the world had yet seen, all things considered and on any large
scale, that ruled from the wall of the Grampians to the garden of the
Euphrates. It was the best that conquered; it was the best that ruled;
and it was the best that began to decay.

Unless this broad truth be grasped, the whole story is seen askew.
Pessimism is not in being tired of evil but in being tired of good.
Despair does not lie in being weary of suffering, but in being weary of
joy. It is when for some reason or other the good things in a society
no longer work that the society begins to decline; when its food does
not feed, when its cures do not cure, when its blessings refuse to
bless. We might almost say that in a society without such good things
we should hardly have any test by which to register a decline; that is
why some of the static commercial oligarchies like Carthage have rather
an air in history of standing and staring like mummies, so dried up
and swathed and embalmed that no man knows when they are new or old.
But Carthage at any rate was dead, and the worst assault ever made by
the demons on mortal society had been defeated. But how much would it
matter that the worst was dead if the best was dying?

To begin with, it must be noted that the relation of Rome to Carthage
was partially repeated and extended in her relation to nations
more normal and more nearly akin to her than Carthage. I am not
here concerned to controvert the merely political view that Roman
statesmen acted unscrupulously towards Corinth or the Greek cities.
But I am concerned to contradict the notion that there was nothing
but a hypocritical excuse in the ordinary Roman dislike of Greek
cities. I am not presenting these pagans as paladins of chivalry,
with a sentiment about nationalism never known until Christian
times. But I am presenting them as men with the feelings of men; and
those feelings were not a pretence. The truth is that one of the
weaknesses in nature-worship and mere mythology had already produced a
perversion among the Greeks due to the worst sophistry; the sophistry
of simplicity. Just as they became unnatural by worshipping nature,
so they actually became unmanly by worshipping man. If Greece led her
conqueror, she might have misled her conqueror; but these were things
he did originally wish to conquer--ever in himself. It is true that in
one sense there was less inhumanity even in Sodom and Gomorrah than in
Tyre and Sidon. When we consider the war of the demons on the children,
we cannot compare even Greek decadence to Punic devil-worship. But
it is not true that the sincere revulsion from either need be merely
pharisaical. It is not true to human nature or to common sense. Let any
lad who has had the luck to grow up sane and simple in his day-dreams
of love hear for the first time of the cult of Ganymede; he will not
be merely shocked but sickened. And that first impression, as has been
said here so often about first impressions, will be right. Our cynical
indifference is an illusion; it is the greatest of all illusions; the
illusion of familiarity. It is right to conceive the more or less
rustic virtues of the ruck of the original Romans as reacting against
the very rumour of it, with complete spontaneity and sincerity. It is
right to regard them as reacting, if in a lesser degree, exactly as
they did against the cruelty of Carthage. Because it was in a less
degree they did not destroy Corinth as they destroyed Carthage. But
if their attitude and action was rather destructive, in neither case
need their indignation have been mere self-righteousness covering mere
selfishness. And if anybody insists that nothing could have operated in
either case but reasons of state and commercial conspiracies, we can
only tell him that there is something which he does not understand;
something which possibly he will never understand; something which,
until he does understand, he will never understand the Latins. That
something is called democracy. He has probably heard the word a good
many times and even used it himself; but he has no notion of what
it means. All through the revolutionary history of Rome there was
an incessant drive towards democracy; the state and the statesman
could do nothing without a considerable backing of democracy; the
sort of democracy that never has anything to do with diplomacy. It is
precisely because of the presence of Roman democracy that we hear so
much about Roman oligarchy. For instance, recent historians have tried
to explain the valour and victory of Rome in terms of that detestable
and detested usury which was practised by some of the Patricians; as
if Curius had conquered the men of the Macedonian phalanx by lending
them money; or the consul Nero had negotiated the victory of Metaurus
at five per cent. But we realise the usury of the Patricians because of
the perpetual revolt of the Plebeians. The rule of the Punic merchant
princes had the very soul of usury. But there was never a Punic mob
that dared to call them usurers.

Burdened like all mortal things with all mortal sin and weakness,
the rise of Rome had really been the rise of normal and especially
of popular things; and in nothing more than in the thoroughly normal
and profoundly popular hatred of perversion. Now among the Greeks a
perversion had become a convention. It is true that it had become so
much of a convention, especially a literary convention, that it was
sometimes conventionally copied by Roman literary men. But this is one
of those complications that always arise out of conventions. It must
not obscure our sense of the difference of tone in the two societies
as a whole. It is true that Virgil would once in a way take over a
theme of Theocritus; but nobody can get the impression that Virgil was
particularly fond of that theme. The themes of Virgil were specially
and notably the normal themes and nowhere more than in morals; piety
and patriotism and the honour of the countryside. And we may well pause
upon the name of the poet as we pass into the autumn of antiquity;
upon his name who was in so supreme a sense the very voice of autumn
of its maturity and its melancholy; of its fruits of fulfilment and
its prospect of decay. Nobody who reads even a few lines of Virgil
can doubt that he understood what moral sanity means to mankind.
Nobody can doubt his feelings when the demons were driven in flight
before the household gods. But there are two particular points about
him and his work which are particularly important to the main thesis
here. The first is that the whole of his great patriotic epic is in
a very peculiar sense founded upon the fall of Troy; that is upon an
avowed pride in Troy although she had fallen. In tracing to Trojans
the foundation of his beloved race and republic, he began what may
be called the great Trojan tradition which runs through medieval and
modern history. We have already seen the first hint of it in the
pathos of Homer about Hector. But Virgil turned it not merely into a
literature but into a legend. And it was a legend of the almost divine
dignity that belongs to the defeated. This was one of the traditions
that did truly prepare the world for the coming of Christianity and
especially of Christian chivalry. This is what did help to sustain
civilisation through the incessant defeats of the Dark Ages and the
barbarian wars; out of which what we call chivalry was born. It is the
moral attitude of the man with his back to the wall; and it was the
wall of Troy. All through medieval and modern times this version of
the virtues in the Homeric conflict can be traced in a hundred ways
co-operating with all that was akin to it in Christian sentiment. Our
own countrymen, and the men of other countries, loved to claim like
Virgil that their own nation was descended from the heroic Trojans.
All sorts of people thought it the most superb sort of heraldry to
claim to be descended from Hector. Nobody seems to have wanted to be
descended from Achilles. The very fact that the Trojan name has become
a Christian name, and been scattered to the last limits of Christendom,
to Ireland or the Gaelic Highlands, while the Greek name has remained
relatively rare and pedantic, is a tribute to the same truth. Indeed it
involves a curiosity of language almost in the nature of a joke. The
name has been turned into a verb; and the very phrase about hectoring,
in the sense of swaggering, suggests the myriads of soldiers who have
taken the fallen Trojan for a model. As a matter of fact, nobody in
antiquity was less given to hectoring than Hector. But even the bully
pretending to be a conqueror took his title from the conquered. That
is why the popularisation of the Trojan origin by Virgil has a vital
relation to all those elements that have made men say that Virgil
was almost a Christian. It is almost as if two great tools or toys
of the same timber, the divine and the human, had been in the hands
of Providence; and the only thing comparable to the Wooden Cross of
Calvary was the Wooden Horse of Troy. So, in some wild allegory, pious
in purpose if almost profane in form, the Holy Child might have fought
the dragon with a wooden sword and a wooden horse.

The other element in Virgil which is essential to the argument is
the particular nature of his relation to mythology; or what may here
in a special sense be called folklore, the faiths and fancies of the
populace. Everybody knows that his poetry at its most perfect is
less concerned with the pomposity of Olympus than with the numina of
natural and agricultural life. Everyone knows where Virgil looked
for the causes of things. He speaks of finding them not so much in
cosmic allegories of Uranus and Chronos; but rather in Pan and the
sisterhood of the nymphs and Sylvanus the old man of the forest. He
is perhaps most himself in some passages of the Eclogues, in which
he has perpetuated for ever the great legend of Arcadia and the
shepherds. Here again it is easy enough to miss the point with petty
criticism about all the things that happen to separate his literary
convention from ours. There is nothing more artificial than the cry
of artificiality as directed against the old pastoral poetry. We have
entirely missed all that our fathers meant by looking at the externals
of what they wrote. People have been so much amused with the mere fact
that the china shepherdess was made of china that they have not even
asked why she was made at all. They have been so content to consider
the Merry Peasant as a figure in an opera that they have not asked even
how he came to go to the opera, or how he strayed on to the stage.

In short, one have only to ask why there is a china shepherdess and
not a china shopkeeper. Why were not mantelpieces adorned with figures
of city merchants in elegant attitudes; of ironmasters wrought in iron
or gold speculators in gold? Why did the opera exhibit a Merry Peasant
and not a Merry Politician? Why was there not a ballet of bankers,
pirouetting upon pointed toes? Because the ancient instinct and humour
of humanity have always told them, under whatever conventions, that
the conventions of complex cities were less really healthy and happy
than the customs of the countryside. So it is with the eternity of
the Eclogues. A modern poet did indeed write things called Fleet
Street Eclogues, in which poets took the place of the shepherds. But
nobody has yet written anything called Wall Street Eclogues, in which
millionaires should take the place of the poets. And the reason is
that there is a real if only a recurrent yearning for that sort of
simplicity; and there is never that sort of yearning for that sort of
complexity. The key to the mystery of the Merry Peasant is that the
peasant often is merry. Those who do not believe it are simply those
who do not know anything about him, and therefore do not know which are
his times for merriment. Those who do not believe in the shepherd's
feast or song are merely ignorant of the shepherd's calendar. The real
shepherd is indeed very different from the ideal shepherd, but that
is no reason for forgetting the reality at the root of the ideal. It
needs a truth to make a tradition. It needs a tradition to make a
convention. Pastoral poetry is certainly often a convention, especially
in a social decline. It was in a social decline that Watteau shepherds
and shepherdesses lounged about the gardens of Versailles. It was also
in a social decline that shepherds and shepherdesses continued to pipe
and dance through the most faded imitations of Virgil. But that is no
reason for dismissing the dying paganism without ever understanding
its life. It is no reason for forgetting that the very word Pagan
is the same as the word Peasant. We may say that this art is only
artificiality; but it is not a love of the artificial. On the contrary,
it is in its very nature only the failure of nature-worship, or the
love of the natural.

For the shepherds were dying because their gods were dying. Paganism
lived upon poetry; that poetry already considered under the name of
mythology. But everywhere, and especially in Italy, it had been a
mythology and a poetry rooted in the countryside; and that rustic
religion had been largely responsible for the rustic happiness. Only
as the whole society grew in age and experience, there began to appear
that weakness in all mythology already noted in the chapter under that
name. This religion was not quite a religion. In other words, this
religion was not quite a reality. It was the young world's riot with
images and ideas like a young man's riot with wine or love-making;
it was not so much immoral as irresponsible; it had no foresight of
the final test of time. Because it was creative to any extent it was
credulous to any extent. It belonged to the artistic side of man,
yet even considered artistically it had long become overloaded and
entangled. The family trees sprung from the seed of Jupiter were a
jungle rather than a forest; the claims of the gods and demi-gods
seemed like things to be settled rather by a lawyer or a professional
herald than by a poet. But it is needless to say that it was not only
in the artistic sense that these things had grown more anarchic. There
had appeared in more and more flagrant fashion that flower of evil
that is really implicit in the very seed of nature-worship, however
natural it may seem. I have said that I do not believe that natural
worship necessarily begins with this particular passion; I am not of
the De Rougemont school of scientific folk-lore. I do not believe that
mythology must begin with eroticism. But I do believe that mythology
must end in it. I am quite certain that mythology did end in it.
Moreover, not only did the poetry grow more immoral, but the immorality
grew more indefensible. Greek vices, oriental vices, hints of the old
horrors of the Semitic demons began to fill the fancies of decaying
Rome, swarming like flies on a dung heap. The psychology of it is
really human enough to anyone who will try that experiment of seeing
history from the inside There comes an hour in the afternoon when the
child is tired of 'pretending'; when he is weary of being a robber or
a Red Indian. It is then that he torments the cat. There comes a time
in the routine of an ordered civilisation when the man is tired at
playing at mythology and pretending that a tree is a maiden or that
the moon made love to a man. The effect of this staleness is the same
everywhere; it is seen in all drug-taking and dram-drinking and every
form of the tendency to increase the dose. Men seek stranger sins or
more startling obscenities as stimulants to their jaded sense. They
seek after mad oriental religions for the same reason. They try to
stab their nerves to life, if it were with the knives of the priests
of Baal. They are walking in their sleep and try to wake themselves up
with nightmares.

At that stage even of paganism therefore the peasant songs and
dances sound fainter and fainter in the forest. For one thing the
peasant civilisation was fading, or had already faded from the
whole countryside. The Empire at the end was organised more and
more on that servile system which generally goes with the boast of
organisation, indeed it was almost as senile as the modern schemes for
the organisation of industry. It is proverbial that what would once
have been a peasantry became a mere populace of the town dependent for
bread and circuses; which may again suggest to some a mob dependent
upon doles and cinemas. In this as in many other respects the modern
return to heathenism has been a return not even to the heathen youth
but rather to the heathen old age. But the causes of it were spiritual
in both cases; and especially the spirit of paganism had departed with
its familiar spirits. The heat had gone out of it with its household
gods, who went along with the gods of the garden and the field and the
forest. The Old Man of the Forest was too old; he was already dying.
It is said truly in a sense that Pan died because Christ was born. It
is almost as true in another sense that men knew that Christ was born
because Pan was already dead. A void was made by the vanishing of the
whole mythology of mankind, which would have asphyxiated like a vacuum
if it had not been filled with theology. But the point for the moment
is that the mythology could not have lasted like a theology in any
case. Theology is thought, whether we agree with it or not. Mythology
was never thought, and nobody could really agree with it or disagree
with it. It was a mere mood of glamour and when the mood went it could
not be recovered. Men not only ceased to believe in the gods, but they
realised that they had never believed in them. They had sung their
praises; they had danced round their altars. They had played the flute;
they had played the fool.

So came the twilight upon Arcady and the last notes of the pipe sound
sadly from the beechen grove. In the great Virgilian poems there is
already something of the sadness; but the loves and the household gods
linger in lovely lines like that which Mr. Belloc took for a test of
understanding; incipe parve puer risu cognoscere matrem. But with
them as with us, the human family itself began to break down under
servile organisation and the herding of the towns. The urban mob became
enlightened; that is it lost the mental energy that could create myths.
All round the circle of the Mediterranean cities the people mourned
for the loss of gods and were consoled with gladiators. And meanwhile
something similar was happening to that intellectual aristocracy of
antiquity that had been walking about and talking at large ever since
Socrates and Pythagoras. They began to betray to the world the fact
that they were walking in a circle and saying the same thing over and
over again. Philosophy began to be a joke; it also began to be a bore.
That unnatural simplification of everything into one system or another,
which we have noted as the fault of the philosopher, revealed at once
its finality and its futility. Everything was virtue or everything was
happiness or everything was fate or everything was good or everything
was bad; anyhow, everything was everything and there was no more to
be said; so they said it. Everywhere the sages had degenerated into
sophists; that is, into hired rhetoricians or askers of riddles. It is
one of the symptoms of this that the sage begins to turn not only into
a sophist but into a magician. A touch of oriental occultism is very
much appreciated in the best houses. As the philosopher is already a
society entertainer, he may as well also be a conjurer.

Many moderns have insisted on the smallness of that Mediterranean
world; and the wider horizons that might have awaited it with the
discovery of the other continents. But this is an illusion, one of the
many illusions of materialism. The limits that paganism had reached
in Europe were the limits of human existence; at its best it had only
reached the same limits anywhere else. The Roman stoics did not need
any Chinamen to teach them stoicism. The Pythagoreans did not need any
Hindus to teach them about recurrence or the simple life or the beauty
of being a vegetarian. In so far as they could get these things from
the East, they had already got rather too much of them from the East.
The Syncretists were as convinced as Theosophists that all religions
are really the same. And how else could they have extended philosophy
merely by extending geography? It can hardly be proposed that they
should learn a purer religion from the Aztecs or sit at the feet of the
Incas of Peru. All the rest of the world was a welter of barbarism.
It is essential to recognise that the Roman Empire was recognised as
the highest achievement of the human race; and also as the broadest. A
dreadful secret seemed to be written as in obscure hieroglyphics across
those mighty works of marble and stone, those colossal amphitheatres
and aqueducts. Man could do no more.

For it was not the message blazed on the Babylonian wall, that one king
was found wanting or his one kingdom given to a stranger. It was no
such good news as the news of invasion and conquest. There was nothing
left that could conquer Rome; but there was also nothing left that
could improve it. It was the strongest thing that was growing weak. It
was the best thing that was going to the bad. It is necessary to insist
again and again that many civilisations had met in one civilisation of
the Mediterranean sea; that it was already universal with a stale and
sterile universality. The peoples had pooled their resources and still
there was not enough. The empires had gone into partnership and they
were still bankrupt. No philosopher who was really philosophical could
think anything except that, in that central sea, the wave of the world
had risen to its highest, seeming to touch the stars. But the wave was
already stooping; for it was only the wave of the world.

That mythology and that philosophy into which paganism has already
been analysed had thus both of them been drained most literally to
the dregs. If with the multiplication of magic the third department,
which we have called the demons, was even increasingly active, it was
never anything but destructive. There remains only the fourth element
or rather the first; that which had been in a sense forgotten because
it was the first. I mean the primary and overpowering yet impalpable
impression that the universe after all has one origin and one aim; and
because it has an aim must have an author. What became of this great
truth in the background of men's minds, at this time, it is perhaps
more difficult to determine. Some of the Stoics undoubtedly saw it
more and more clearly as the clouds of mythology cleared and thinned
away; and great men among them did much even to the last to lay the
foundations of a concept of the moral unity of the world. The Jews
still held their secret certainty of it jealously behind high fences of
exclusiveness; yet it is intensely characteristic of the society and
the situation that some fashionable figures, especially fashionable
ladies, actually embraced Judaism. But in the case of many others I
fancy there entered at this point a new negation. Atheism became really
possible in that abnormal time; for atheism is abnormality. It is not
merely the denial of a dogma. It is the reversal of a subconscious
assumption in the soul; the sense that there is a meaning and a
direction in the world it sees. Lucretius, the first evolutionist
who endeavoured to substitute Evolution for God, had already dangled
before men's eyes his dance of glittering atoms, by which he conceived
cosmos as created by chaos. But it was not his strong poetry or his
sad philosophy, as I fancy, that made it possible for men to entertain
such a vision. It was something in the sense of impotence and despair
with which men shook their fists vainly at the stars, as they saw all
the best work of humanity sinking slowly and helplessly into a swamp.
They could easily believe that even creation itself was not a creation
but a perpetual fall, when they saw that the weightiest and worthiest
of all human creations was falling by its own weight. They could fancy
that all the stars were falling stars; and that the very pillars of
their own solemn porticos were bowed under a sort of gradual deluge. To
men in that mood there was a reason for atheism that is in some sense
reasonable. Mythology might fade and philosophy might stiffen; but if
behind these things there was a reality, surely that reality might have
sustained things as they sank. There was no God; if there had been a
God, surely this was the very moment when He would have moved and saved
the world.

The life of the great civilisation went on with dreary industry and
even with dreary festivity. It was the end of the world, and the
worst of it was that it need never end. A convenient compromise had
been made between all the multitudinous myths and religions of the
Empire; that each group should worship freely and merely live a sort
of official flourish of thanks to the tolerant Emperor, by tossing a
little incense to him under his official title of Divus. Naturally
there was no difficulty about that; or rather it was a long time before
the world realised that there ever had been even a trivial difficulty
anywhere. The members of some Eastern sect or secret society or other
seemed to have made a scene somewhere; nobody could imagine why. The
incident occurred once or twice again and began to arouse irritation
out of proportion to its insignificance. It was not exactly what these
provincials said; though of course it sounded queer enough. They seemed
to be saying that God was dead and that they themselves had seen him
die. This might be one of the many manias produced by the despair of
the age; only they did not seem particularly despairing. They seem
quite unnaturally joyful about it, and gave the reason that the death
of God had allowed them to eat him and drink his blood. According
to other accounts God was not exactly dead after all; there trailed
through the bewildered imagination some sort of fantastic procession
of the funeral of God, at which the sun turned black, but which ended
with the dead omnipotence breaking out of the tomb and rising again
like the sun. But it was not the strange story to which anybody paid
any particular attention; people in that world had seen queer religions
enough to fill a madhouse. It was something in the tone of the madmen
and their type of formation. They were a scratch company of barbarians
and slaves and poor and unimportant people; but their formation was
military; they moved together and were very absolute about who and
what was really a part of their little system; and about what they
said. However mildly, there was a ring like iron. Men used to many
mythologies and moralities could make no analysis of the mystery,
except the curious conjecture that they meant what they said. All
attempts to make them see reason in the perfectly simple matter of
the Emperor's statue seemed to be spoken to deaf men. It was as if a
new meteoric metal had fallen on the earth; it was a difference of
substance to the touch. Those who touched their foundation fancied they
had struck a rock.

With a strange rapidity, like the changes of a dream, the proportions
of things seemed to change in their presence. Before most men knew what
had happened, these few men were palpably present. They were important
enough to be ignored. People became suddenly silent about them and
walked stiffly past them. We see a new scene, in which the world has
drawn its skirts away from these men and women and they stand in the
centre of a great space like lepers. The scene changes again and the
great space where they stand is overhung on every side with a cloud of
witnesses, interminable terraces full of faces looking down towards
them intently; for strange things are happening to them. New tortures
have been invented for the madmen who have brought good news. That sad
and weary society seems almost to find a new energy in establishing its
first religious persecution. Nobody yet knows very clearly why that
level world has thus lost its balance about the people in its midst;
but they stand unnaturally still while the arena and the world seem to
revolve round them. And there shone on them in that dark hour a light
that has never been darkened; a white fire clinging to that group like
an unearthly phosphorescence, blazing its track through the twilights
of history and confounding every effort to confound it with the mists
of mythology and theory; that shaft of light or lightning by which the
world itself has struck and isolated and crowned it; by which its own
enemies have made it more illustrious and its own critics have made it
more inexplicable; the halo of hatred around the Church of God.

PART II

ON THE MAN CALLED CHRIST

* * *


THE GOD IN THE CAVE

This sketch of the human story began in a cave; the cave which
popular science associates with the cave-man and in which practical
discovery has really found archaic drawings of animals. The second
half of human history, which was like a new creation of the world,
also begins in a cave. There is even a shadow of such a fancy in the
fact that animals were again present; for it was a cave used as a
stable by the mountaineers of the uplands about Bethlehem; who still
drive their cattle into such holes and caverns at night. It was here
that a homeless couple had crept underground with the cattle when the
doors of the crowded caravanserai had been shut in their faces; and it
was here beneath the very feet of the passers-by, in a cellar under
the very floor of the world, that Jesus Christ was born. But in that
second creation there was indeed something symbolical in the roots of
the primeval rock or the horns of the prehistoric herd. God also was a
Cave-Man, and had also traced strange shapes of creatures, curiously
coloured, upon the wall of the world; but the pictures that he made had
come to life.

A mass of legend and literature, which increases and will never end,
has repeated and rung the changes on that single paradox; that the
hands that had made the sun and stars were too small to reach the
huge heads of the cattle. Upon this paradox, we might almost say upon
this jest, all the literature of our faith is founded. It is at least
like a jest in this, that it is something which the scientific critic
cannot see. He laboriously explains the difficulty which we have always
defiantly and almost derisively exaggerated; and mildly condemns as
improbable something that we have almost madly exalted as incredible;
as something that would be much too good to be true, except that it is
true. When that contrast between the cosmic creation and the little
local infancy has been repeated, reiterated, underlined, emphasised,
exulted in, sung, shouted, roared, not to say howled, in a hundred
thousand hymns, carols, rhymes, rituals, pictures, poems, and popular
sermons, it may be suggested that we hardly need a higher critic to
draw our attention to something a little odd about it; especially one
of the sort that seems to take a long time to see a joke, even his
own joke. But about this contrast and combination of ideas one thing
may be said here, because it is relevant to the whole thesis of this
book. The sort of modern critic of whom I speak is generally much
impressed with the importance of education in life and the importance
of psychology in education. That sort of man is never tired of telling
us that first impressions fix character by the law of causation; and he
will become quite nervous if a child's visual sense is poisoned by the
wrong colours on a golliwog or his nervous system prematurely shaken
by a cacophonous rattle. Yet he will think us very narrow-minded, if
we say that this is exactly why there really is a difference between
being brought up as a Christian and being brought up as a Jew or a
Moslem or an atheist. The difference is that every Catholic child
has learned from pictures, and even every Protestant child from
stories, this incredible combination of contrasted ideas as one of the
very first impressions on his mind. It is not merely a theological
difference. It is a psychological difference which can outlast any
theologies. It really is, as that sort of scientist loves to say about
anything, incurable. Any agnostic or atheist whose childhood has known
a real Christmas has ever afterwards, whether he likes it or not, an
association in his mind between two ideas that most of mankind must
regard as remote from each other; the idea of a baby and the idea of
unknown strength that sustains the stars. His instincts and imagination
can still connect them, when his reason can no longer see the need of
the connection; for him there will always be some savour of religion
about the mere picture of a mother and a baby; some hint of mercy and
softening about the mere mention of the dreadful name of God. But the
two ideas are not naturally or necessarily combined. They would not
be necessarily combined for an ancient Greek or a Chinaman, even for
Aristotle or Confucius. It is no more inevitable to connect God with an
infant than to connect gravitation with a kitten. It has been created
in our minds by Christmas because we are Christians, because we are
psychological Christians even when we are not theological ones. In
other words, this combination of ideas has emphatically, in the much
disputed phrase, altered human nature. There is really a difference
between the man who knows it and the man who does not. It may not be a
difference of moral worth, for the Moslem or the Jew might be worthier
according to his lights; but it is a plain fact about the crossing of
two particular lights, the conjunction of two stars in our particular
horoscope. Omnipotence and impotence, or divinity and infancy, do
definitely make a sort of epigram which a million repetitions cannot
turn into a platitude. It is not unreasonable to call it unique.
Bethlehem is emphatically a place where extremes meet.

Here begins, it is needless to say, another mighty influence for the
humanisation of Christendom. If the world wanted what is called a
non-controversial aspect of Christianity, it would probably select
Christmas. Yet it is obviously bound up with what is supposed to be
a controversial aspect (I could never at any stage of my opinions
imagine why); the respect paid to the Blessed Virgin. When I was a
boy a more Puritan generation objected to a statue upon my parish
church representing the Virgin and Child. After much controversy, they
compromised by taking away the Child. One would think that this was
even more corrupted with Mariolatry, unless the mother was counted
less dangerous when deprived of a sort of weapon. But the practical
difficulty is also a parable. You cannot chip away the statue of a
mother from all round that of a new-born child. You can not suspend
the new-born child in mid-air; indeed you cannot really have a statue
of a new-born child at all. Similarly, you cannot suspend the idea
of a new-born child in the void or think of him without thinking of
his mother. You cannot visit the child without visiting the mother;
you cannot in common human life approach the child except through the
mother. If we are to think of Christ in this aspect at all, the other
idea follows as it is followed in history. We must either leave Christ
out of Christmas, or Christmas out of Christ, or we must admit, if only
as we admit it in an old picture, that those holy heads are too near
together for the haloes not to mingle and cross.

It might be suggested, in a somewhat violent image, that nothing had
happened in that fold or crack in the great grey hills except that the
whole universe had been turned inside out. I mean that all the eyes of
wonder and worship which had been turned outwards to the largest thing
were now turned inward to the smallest. The very image will suggest
all that multitudinous marvel of converging eyes that makes so much of
the coloured Catholic imagery like a peacock's tail. But it is true
in a sense that God who had been only a circumference was seen as a
centre; and a centre is infinitely small. It is true that the spiritual
spiral henceforward works inwards instead of outwards, and in that
sense is centripetal and not centrifugal. The faith becomes, in more
ways than one, a religion of little things. But its traditions in art
and literature and popular fable have quite sufficiently attested,
as has been said, this particular paradox of the divine being in the
cradle. Perhaps they have not so clearly emphasised the significance
of the divine being in the cave. Curiously enough, indeed, tradition
has not very clearly emphasised the cave. It is a familiar fact that
the Bethlehem scene has been represented in every possible setting of
time and country, of landscape and architecture; and it is a wholly
happy and admirable fact that men have conceived it as quite different
according to their different individual traditions and tastes. But
while all have realised that it was a stable, not so many have realised
that it was a cave. Some critics have even been so silly as to suppose
that there was some contradiction between the stable and the cave; in
which case they cannot know much about caves or stables in Palestine.
As they see differences that are not there, it is needless to add that
they do not see differences that are there. When a well-known critic
says, for instance, that Christ being born in a rocky cavern is like
Mithras having sprung alive out of a rock, it sounds like a parody upon
comparative religion. There is such a thing as the point of a story,
even if it is a story in the sense of a lie. And the notion of a hero
appearing, like Pallas from the brain of Zeus, mature and without a
mother, is obviously the very opposite of the idea of a god being born
like an ordinary baby and entirely dependent on a mother. Whichever
ideal we might prefer, we should surely see that they are contrary
ideals. It is as stupid to connect them because they both contain a
substance called stone as to identify the punishment of the Deluge with
the baptism in the Jordan because they both contain a substance called
water. Whether as a myth or a mystery, Christ was obviously conceived
as born in a hole in the rocks primarily because it marked the position
of one outcast and homeless. Nevertheless it is true, as I have said,
that the cave has not been so commonly or so clearly used as a symbol
as the other realities that surrounded the first Christmas.

And the reason for this also refers to the very nature of that new
world. It was in a sense the difficulty of a new dimension. Christ was
not only born on the level of the world, but even lower than the world.
The first act of the divine drama was enacted, not only on no stage set
up above the sight-seer, but on a dark and curtained stage sunken out
of sight; and that is an idea very difficult to express in most modes
of artistic expression. It is the idea of simultaneous happenings on
different levels of life. Something like it might have been attempted
in the more archaic and decorative medieval art. But the more the
artists learned of realism and perspective, the less they could depict
at once the angels in the heavens and the shepherds on the hills, and
the glory in the darkness that was under the hills. Perhaps it could
have been best conveyed by the characteristic expedient of some of the
medieval guilds, when they wheeled about the streets a theatre with
three stages one above the other, with heaven above the earth and hell
under the earth. But in the riddle of Bethlehem it was heaven that was
under the earth.

There is in that alone the touch of a revolution, as of the world
turned upside down. It would be vain to attempt to say anything
adequate, or anything new, about the change which this conception of
a deity born like an outcast or even an outlaw had upon the whole
conception of law and its duties to the poor and outcast. It is
profoundly true to say that after that moment there could be no slaves.
There could be and were people bearing that legal title, until the
Church was strong enough to weed them out, but there could be no more
of the pagan repose in the mere advantage to the state of keeping it
a servile state. Individuals became important, in a sense in which no
instruments can be important. A man could not be a means to an end, at
any rate to any other man's end. All this popular and fraternal element
in the story has been rightly attached by tradition to the episode of
the Shepherds; the hinds who found themselves talking face to face
with the princes of heaven. But there is another aspect of the popular
element as represented by the shepherds which has not perhaps been so
fully developed; and which is more directly relevant here.

Men of the people, like the shepherds, men of the popular tradition,
had everywhere been the makers of the mythologies. It was they who had
felt most directly, with least check or chill from philosophy or the
corrupt cults of civilisation, the need we have already considered;
the images that were adventures of the imagination; the mythology that
was a sort of search; the tempting and tantalising hints of something
half-human in nature; the dumb significance of seasons and special
places. They had best understood that the soul of a landscape is a
story and the soul of a story is a personality. But rationalism had
already begun to rot away these really irrational though imaginative
treasures of the peasant; even as systematic slavery had eaten the
peasant out of house and home. Upon all such peasantries everywhere
there was descending a dusk and twilight of disappointment, in the
hour when these few men discovered what they sought. Everywhere else
Arcadia was fading from the forest. Pan was dead and the shepherds were
scattered like sheep. And though no man knew it, the hour was near
which was to end and to fulfil all things; and though no man heard
it, there was one far-off cry in an unknown tongue upon the heaving
wilderness of the mountains. The shepherds had found their Shepherd.

And the thing they found was of a kind with the things they sought.
The populace had been wrong in many things; but they had not been
wrong in believing that holy things could have a habitation and that
divinity need not disdain the limits of time and space. And the
barbarian who conceived the crudest fancy about the sun being stolen
and hidden in a box, or the wildest myth about the god being rescued
and his enemy deceived with a stone, was nearer to the secret of the
cave and knew more about the crisis of the world, than all those in
the circle of cities round the Mediterranean who had become content
with cold abstractions or cosmopolitan generalisations; than all those
who were spinning thinner and thinner threads of thought out of the
transcendentalism of Plato or the orientalism of Pythagoras. The place
that the shepherds found was not an academy or an abstract republic,
it was not a place of myths allegorised or dissected or explained or
explained away. It was a place of dreams come true. Since that hour no
mythologies have been made in the world. Mythology is a search.

We all know that the popular presentation of this popular story, in so
many miracle plays and carols, has given to the shepherds the costumes,
the language, and the landscape of the separate English and European
countrysides. We all know that one shepherd will talk in a Somerset
dialect or another talk of driving his sheep from Conway towards Clyde.
Most of us know by this time how true is that error, how wise, how
artistic, how intensely Christian and Catholic is that anachronism.
But some who have seen it in these scenes of medieval rusticity have
perhaps not seen it in another sort of poetry, which it is sometimes
the fashion to call artificial rather than artistic. I fear that many
modern critics will see only a faded classicism in the fact that men
like Crashaw and Herrick conceived the shepherds of Bethlehem under the
form of the shepherds of Virgil. Yet they were profoundly right; and in
turning their Bethlehem play into a Latin Eclogue they took up one of
the most important links in human history. Virgil, as we have already
seen, does stand for all that saner heathenism that had over-thrown
the insane heathenism of human sacrifice; but the very fact that even
the Virgilian virtues and the sane heathenism were in incurable decay
is the whole problem to which the revelation to the shepherds is the
solution. If the world had ever had the chance to grow weary of being
demoniac, it might have been healed merely by becoming sane. But if it
had grown weary even of being sane, what was to happen, except what
did happen? Nor is it false to conceive the Arcadian shepherd of the
Eclogues as rejoicing in what did happen. One of the Eclogues has even
been claimed as a prophecy of what did happen. But it is quite as much
in the tone and incidental diction of the great poet that we feel the
potential sympathy with the great event; and even in their own human
phrases the voices of the Virgilian shepherds might more than once have
broken upon more than the tenderness of Italy `Incipe, parve puer, risu
cognoscere matrem' They might have found in that strange place all that
was best in the last traditions of the Latins; and something better
than a wooden idol standing up for ever for the pillar of the human
family; a household god. But they and all the other mythologists would
be justified in rejoicings that the event had fulfilled not merely
the mysticism but the materialism of mythology. Mythology had many
sins; but it had not been wrong in being as carnal as the Incarnation.
But something of the ancient voice that was supposed to have rung
through the graves, it could cry again, 'We have seen, he hath seen
us, a visible god.' So the ancient shepherds might have danced, and
their feet have been beautiful upon the mountains, rejoicing over the
philosophers. But the philosophers had also heard.

It is still a strange story, though an old one, how they came out
of orient lands, crowned with the majesty of kings and clothed with
something of the mystery of magicians. That truth that is tradition
his wisely remembered them almost as unknown quantities, as mysterious
as their mysterious and melodious names; Melchior. Caspar, Balthazar.
But there came with them all that world of wisdom that had watched
the stars in Chaldea and the sun in Persia; and we shall not be wrong
if we see in them the same curiosity that moves all the sages. They
would stand for the same human ideal if their names had really been
Confucius or Pythagoras or Plato. They were those who sought not tales
but the truth of things, and since their thirst for truth was itself a
thirst for God, they also have had their reward. But even in order to
understand that reward, we must understand that for philosophy as much
as mythology, that reward was the completion of the incomplete.

Such learned men would doubtless have come, as these learned men did
come, to find themselves confirmed in much that was true in their own
traditions and right in their own reasoning. Confucius would have
found a new foundation for the family in the very reversal of the Holy
Family; Buddha would have looked upon a new renunciation, of stars
rather than jewels and divinity than royalty. These learned men would
still have the right to say, or rather a new right to say, that there
was truth in their old teaching. But after all these learned men would
have come to learn. They would have come to complete their conceptions
with something they had not yet conceived; even to balance their
imperfect universe with something they might once have contradicted.
Buddha would have come from his impersonal paradise to worship a
person. Confucius would have come from his temples of ancestor-worship
to worship a child.

We must grasp from the first this character in the new cosmos; that it
was larger than the old cosmos. In that sense Christendom is larger
than creation; as creation had been before Christ. It included things
that had not been there; it also included the things that had been
there. The point happens to be well illustrated in this example of
Chinese piety, but it would be true of other pagan virtues or pagan
beliefs. Nobody can doubt that a reasonable respect for parents is part
of a gospel in which God himself was subject in childhood to earthly
parents. But the other sense in which the parents were subject to
him does introduce an idea that is not Confucian. The infant Christ
is not like the infant Confucius; our mysticism conceives him in an
immortal infancy. I do not know what Confucius would have done with the
Bambino had it come to life in his arms as it did in the arms of St.
Francis. But this is true in relation to all the other religions and
philosophies; it is the challenge of the Church. The Church contains
what the world does not contain. Life itself does not provide as she
does for all sides of life. That every other single system is narrow
and insufficient compared to this one; that is not a rhetorical boast;
it is a real fact and a real dilemma. Where is the Holy child amid
the Stoics and the ancestor-worshippers? Where is Our Lady of the
Moslems, a woman made for no man and set above all angels? Where is
St. Michael of the monks of Buddha, rider and master of the trumpets,
guarding for every soldier the honour of the sword? What could St.
Thomas Aquinas do with the mythology of Brahminism, he who set forth
all the science and rationality and even rationalism of Christianity?
Yet even if we compare Aquinas with Aristotle, at the other extreme
of reason, we shall find the same sense of something added. Aquinas
could understand the most logical parts of Aristotle; it is doubtful
if Aristotle could have understood the most mystical parts of Aquinas.
Even where we can hardly call the Christian greater, we are forced
to call him larger. But it is so to whatever philosophy or heresy or
modern movement we may turn. How would Francis the Troubadour have
fared among the Calvinists, or for that matter among the Utilitarians
of the Manchester School? Yet men like Bossuet and Pascal could be as
stern and logical as any Calvinist or Utilitarian. How would St. Joan
of Arc, a woman waving on men to war with the sword, have fared among
the Quakers or the Doukhabors or the Tolstoyan sect of pacifists? Yet
any number of Catholic saints have spent their lives in preaching peace
and preventing wars. It is the same with all the modern attempts at
Syncretism. They are never able to make something larger than the Creed
without leaving something out. I do not mean leaving out something
divine but something human; the flag or the inn or the boy's tale of
battle or the hedge at the end of the field. The Theosophists build
a pantheon; but it is only a pantheon for pantheists. They call a
Parliament of Religions as a reunion of all the peoples; but it is
only a reunion of all the prigs. Yet exactly such a pantheon had been
set up two thousand years before by the shores of the Mediterranean;
and Christians were invited to set up the image of Jesus side by side
with the image of Jupiter, of Mithras, of Osiris, of Atys, or of
Ammon. It was the refusal of the Christians that was the turning-point
of history. If the Christians had accepted, they and the whole world
would have certainly, in a grotesque but exact metaphor, gone to pot.
They would all have been boiled down to one lukewarm liquid in that
great pot of cosmopolitan corruption in which all the other myths
and mysteries were already melting. It was an awful and an appalling
escape. Nobody understands the nature of the Church, or the ringing
note of the creed descending from antiquity, who does not realise
that the whole world once very nearly died of broadmindedness and the
brotherhood of all religions.

Here it is the important point that the Magi, who stand for mysticism
and philosophy, are truly conceived as seeking something new and even
as finding something unexpected. That tense sense of crisis which still
tingles in the Christmas story and even in every Christmas celebration,
accentuates the idea of a search and a discovery. The discovery is, in
this case, truly a scientific discovery. For the other mystical figures
in the miracle play; for the angel and the mother, the shepherds and
the soldiers of Herod, there may be aspects both simpler and more
supernatural, more elemental or more emotional. But the wise Men must
be seeking wisdom, and for them there must be a light also in the
intellect. And this is the light; that the Catholic creed is catholic
and that nothing else is catholic. The philosophy of the Church is
universal. The philosophy of the philosophers was not universal. Had
Plato and Pythagoras and Aristotle stood for an instant in the light
that came out of that little cave, they would have known that their own
light was not universal. It is far from certain, indeed, that they did
not know it already. Philosophy also, like mythology, had very much
the air of a search. It is the realisation of this truth that gives
its traditional majesty and mystery to the figures of the Three Kings;
the discovery that religion is broader than philosophy and that this
is the broadest of religions, contained within this narrow space. The
Magicians were gazing at the strange pentacle with the human triangle
reversed; and they have never come to the end of their calculations
about it. For it is the paradox of that group in the cave, that while
our emotions about it are of childish simplicity, our thoughts about
it can branch with a never-ending complexity. And we can never reach
the end even of our own ideas about the child who was a father and the
mother who was a child.

We might well be content to say that mythology had come with the
shepherds and philosophy with the philosophers; and that it only
remained for them to combine in the recognisation of religion. But
there was a third element that must not be ignored and one which that
religion for ever refuses to ignore, in any revel or reconciliation.
There was present in the primary scenes of the drama that Enemy that
had rotted the legends with lust and frozen theories into atheism,
but which answered the direct challenge with something of that more
direct method which we have seen in the conscious cult of the demons.
In the description of that demon-worship, of the devouring detestation
of innocence shown in the works of its witchcraft and the most
inhuman of its human sacrifice, I have said less of its incorrect and
secret penetration of the saner paganism; the soaking of mythological
imagination with sex; the rise of imperial pride into insanity. But
both the indirect and the direct influence make themselves felt in
the drama of Bethlehem. A ruler under the Roman suzerainty, probably
equipped and surrounded with the Roman ornament and order though
himself of eastern blood, seems in that hour to have felt stirring
within him the spirit of strange things. We all know the story of how
Herod, alarmed at some rumour of a mysterious rival, remembered the
wild gesture of the capricious despots of Asia and ordered a massacre
of suspects of the new generation of the populace. Everyone knows the
story; but not everyone has perhaps noted its place in the story of the
strange religions of men. Not everybody has seen the significance even
of its very contrast with the Corinthian columns and Roman pavement of
that conquered and superficially civilised world. Only, as the purpose
in his dark spirit began to show and shine in the eyes of the Idumean,
a seer might perhaps have seen something like a great grey ghost
that looked over his shoulder; have seen behind him filling the dome
of night and hovering for the last time over history, that vast and
fearful face that was Moloch of the Carthaginians; awaiting his last
tribute from a ruler of the races of Shem. The demons also, in that
first festival of Christmas, feasted after their own fashion.

Unless we understand the presence of that enemy, we shall not only
miss the point of Christianity, but even miss the point of Christmas.
Christmas for us in Christendom has become one thing, and in one
sense even a simple thing. But like all the truths of that tradition,
it is in another sense a very complex thing. Its unique note is the
simultaneous striking of many notes; of humility, of gaiety, of
gratitude, of mystical fear, but also of vigilance and of drama. It
is not only an occasion for the peacemakers any more than for the
merry-makers; it is not only a Hindu peace conference any more than it
is only a Scandinavian winter feast. There is something defiant in it
also; something that makes the abrupt bells at midnight sound like the
great guns of a battle that has just been won. All this indescribable
thing that we call the Christmas atmosphere only hangs in the air as
something like a lingering fragrance or fading vapour from the exultant
explosion of that one hour in the Judean hills nearly two thousand
years ago. But the savour is still unmistakable, and it is something
too subtle or too solitary to be covered by our use of the word peace.
By the very nature of the story the rejoicings in the cavern were
rejoicings in a fortress or an outlaw's den; properly understood it
is not unduly flippant to say they were rejoicings in a dug-out. It
is not only true that such a subterranean chamber was a hiding-place
from enemies; and that the enemies were already scouring the stony
plain that lay above it like a sky. It is not only that the very
horse-hoofs of Herod might in that sense have passed like thunder over
the sunken head of Christ. It is also that there is in that image a
true idea of an outpost, of a piercing through the rock and an entrance
into an enemy territory. There is in this buried divinity an idea of
undermining the world; of shaking the towers and palaces from below;
even as Herod the great king felt that earthquake under him and swayed
with his swaying palace.

That is perhaps the mightiest of the mysteries of the cave It is
already apparent that though men are said to have looked for hell
under the earth, in this case it is rather heaven that is under
the earth And there follows in this strange story the idea of an
upheaval of heaven. That is the paradox of the whole position; that
henceforth the highest thing can only work from below. Royalty can
only return to its own by a sort of rebellion. Indeed the Church from
its beginnings, and perhaps especially in its beginnings, was not so
much a principality as a revolution against the prince of the world.
This sense that the world had been conquered by the great usurper,
and was in his possession, has been much deplored or derided by those
optimists who identify enlightenment with ease. But it was responsible
for all that thrill of defiance and a beautiful danger that made the
good news seem to be really both good and new. It was in truth against
a huge unconscious usurpation that it raised a revolt, and originally
so obscure a revolt. Olympus still occupied the sky like a motionless
cloud moulded into many mighty forms; philosophy still sat in the high
places and even on the thrones of the kings, when Christ was born in
the cave and Christianity in the catacombs. In both cases we may remark
the same paradox of revolution; the sense of something despised and of
something feared The cave in one aspect is only a hole or corner into
which the outcasts are swept like rubbish; yet in the other aspect it
is a hiding-place of something valuable which the tyrants are seeking
like treasure. In one sense they are there because the innkeeper would
not even remember them, and in another because the king can never
forget them. We have already noted that this paradox appeared also
in the treatment of the early Church. It was important while it was
still insignificant, and certainly while it was still impotent. It
was important solely because it was intolerable; and in that sense it
is true to say that it was intolerable because it was intolerant. It
was resented, because, in its own still and almost secret way, it had
declared war. It had risen out of the ground to wreck the heaven and
earth of heathenism. It did not try to destroy all that creation of
gold and marble; but it contemplated a world without it. It dared to
look right through it as though the gold and marble had been glass.
Those who charged the Christians with burning down Rome with firebrands
were slanderers; but they were at least far nearer to the nature
of Christianity than those among the moderns who tell us that the
Christians were a sort of ethical society, being martyred in a languid
fashion for telling men they had a duty to their neighbors, and only
mildly disliked because they were meek and mild.

Herod had his place, therefore, in the miracle play of Bethlehem
because he is the menace to the Church Militant and shows it from the
first as under persecution and fighting for its life. For those who
think this a discord, it is a discord that sounds simultaneously with
the Christmas bells. For those who think the idea of the Crusade is
one that spoils the idea of the Cross, we can only say that for them
the idea of the Cross is spoiled; the idea of the cross is spoiled
quite literally in the cradle. It is not here to the purpose to argue
with them on the abstract ethics of fighting; the purpose in this
place is merely to sum up the combination of ideas that make up the
Christian and Catholic idea, and to note that all of them are already
crystallised in the first Christmas story. They are three distinct
and commonly contrasted things which are nevertheless one thing; but
this is the only thing which can make them one. The first is the human
instinct for a heaven that shall be as literal and almost as local
as a home. It is the idea pursued by all poets and pagans making
myths; that a particular place must be the shrine of the god or the
abode of the blest; that fairyland is a land; or that the return of
the ghost must be the resurrection of the body. I do not here reason
about the refusal of rationalism to satisfy this need. I only say
that if the rationalists refuse to satisfy it, the pagans will not be
satisfied. This is present in the story of Bethlehem and Jerusalem
as it is present in the story of Delos and Delphi; and as it is not
present in the whole universe of Lucretius or the whole universe of
Herbert Spencer. The second element is a philosophy larger than other
philosophies; larger than that of Lucretius and infinitely larger
than that of Herbert Spencer. It looks at the world through a hundred
windows where the ancient stoic or the modern agnostic only looks
through one. It sees life with thousands of eyes belonging to thousands
of different sorts of people, where the other is only the individual
standpoint of a stoic or an agnostic. It has something for all moods
of man, it finds work for all kinds of men, it understands secrets of
psychology, it is aware of depths of evil, it is able to distinguish
between ideal and unreal marvels and miraculous exceptions, it trains
itself in tact about hard cases, all with a multiplicity and subtlety
and imagination about the varieties of life which is far beyond the
bald or breezy platitudes of most ancient or modern moral philosophy.
In a word, there is more in it; it finds more in existence to think
about; it gets more out of life. Masses of this material about our
many-sided life have been added since the time of St. Thomas Aquinas.
But St. Thomas Aquinas alone would have found himself limited in the
world of Confucius or of Comte. And the third point is this; that while
it is local enough for poetry and larger than any other philosophy, it
is also a challenge and a fight. While it is deliberately broadened to
embrace every aspect of truth, it is still stiffly embattled against
every mode of error. It gets every kind of man to fight for it, it gets
every kind of weapon to fight with, it widens its knowledge of the
things that are fought for and against with every art of curiosity or
sympathy; but it never forgets that it is fighting. It proclaims peace
on earth and never forgets why there was war in heaven.

This is the trinity of truths symbolised here by the three types in the
old Christmas story; the shepherds and the kings and that other king
who warred upon the children. It is simply not true to say that other
religions and philosophies are in this respect its rivals. It is not
true to say that any one of them combines these characters; it is not
true to say that any one of them pretends to combine them. Buddhism
may profess to be equally mystical; it does not even profess to be
equally military. Islam may profess to be equally military; it does
not even profess to be equally metaphysical and subtle. Confucianism
may profess to satisfy the need of the philosophers for order and
reason; it does not even profess to satisfy the need of the mystics for
miracle and sacrament and the consecration of concrete things. There
are many evidences of this presence of a spirit at once universal and
unique. One will serve here which is the symbol of the subject of this
chapter; that no other story, no pagan legend or philosophical anecdote
or historical event, does in fact affect any of us with that peculiar
and even poignant impression produced on us by the word Bethlehem. No
other birth of a god or childhood of a sage seems to us to be Christmas
or anything like Christmas. It is either too cold or too frivolous, or
too formal and classical, or too simple and savage, or too occult and
complicated. Not one of us, whatever his opinions, would ever go to
such a scene with the sense that he was going home. He might admire it
because it was poetical, or because it was philosophical, or any number
of other things in separation; but not because it was itself. The truth
is that there is a quite peculiar and individual character about the
hold of this story on human nature; it is not in its psychological
substance at all like a mere legend or the life of a great man. It
does not exactly in the ordinary sense turn our minds to greatness; to
those extensions and exaggerations of humanity which are turned into
gods and heroes, even by the healthiest sort of hero-worship. It does
not exactly work outwards, adventurously, to the wonders to be found at
the ends of the earth. It is rather something that surprises us from
behind, from the hidden and personal part of our being; like that which
can some times take us off our guard in the pathos of small objects
or the blind pieties of the poor. It is rather as if a man had found
an inner room in the very heart of his own house, which he had never
suspected; and seen a light from within. It is as if he found something
at the back of his own heart that betrayed him into good. It is not
made of what the world would call strong materials; or rather it is
made of materials whose strength is in that winged levity with which
they brush us and pass. It is all that is in us but a brief tenderness
that is there made eternal; all that means no more than a momentary
softening that is in some strange fashion become a strengthening and
a repose; it is the broken speech and the lost word that are made
positive and suspended unbroken; as the strange kings fade into a
far country and the mountains resound no more with the feet of the
shepherds; and only the night and the cavern lie in fold upon fold over
something more human than humanity.

II

THE RIDDLES OF THE GOSPEL

To understand the nature of this chapter, it is necessary to recur to
the nature of this book. The argument which is meant to be the backbone
of the book is of the kind called the reductio ad absurdum. It suggests
that the results of assuming the rationalist thesis are more irrational
than ours; but to prove it we must assume that thesis. Thus in the
first section I often treated man as merely an animal, to show that
the effect was more impossible than if he were treated as an angel. In
the sense in which it was necessary to treat man merely as an animal,
it is necessary to treat Christ merely as a man. I have to suspend my
own beliefs, which are much more positive; and assume this limitation
even in order to remove it. I must try to imagine what would happen to
a man who did really read the story of Christ as the story of a man;
and even of a man of whom he had never heard before. And I wish to
point out that a really impartial reading of that kind would lead, if
not immediately to belief, at least to a bewilderment of which there is
really no solution except in belief. In this chapter, for this reason,
I shall bring in nothing of the spirit of my own creed; I shall exclude
the very style of diction, and even of lettering, which I should think
fitting in speaking in my own person. I am speaking as an imaginary
heathen human being, honestly, staring at the Gospel story for the
first time.

Now it is not at all easy to regard the New Testament as a New
Testament. It is not at all easy to realise the good news as new.
Both for good and evil familiarity fills us with assumptions and
associations; and no man of our civilisation, whatever he thinks of
our religion, can really read the thing as if he had never heard of
it before. Of course it is in any case utterly unhistorical to talk
as if the New Testament were a neatly bound book that had fallen
from heaven. It is simply the selection made by the authority of the
Church from a mass of early Christian literature. But apart from any
such question there is a psychological difficulty in feeling the New
Testament as new. There is a psychological difficulty in seeing those
well-known words simply as they stand and without going beyond what
they intrinsically stand for. And this difficulty must indeed be very
great; for the result of it is very curious. The result of it is that
most modern critics and most current criticism, even popular criticism,
makes a comment that is the exact reverse of the truth. It is so
completely the reverse of the truth that one could almost suspect that
they had never read the New Testament at all.

We have all heard people say a hundred times over, for they seem never
to tire of saying it, that the Jesus of the New Testament is indeed a
most merciful and humane lover of humanity, but that the Church has
hidden this human character in repellent dogmas and stiffened it with
ecclesiastical terrors till it has taken on an inhuman character. This
is, I venture to repeat, very nearly the reverse of the truth. The
truth is that it is the image of Christ in the churches that is almost
entirely mild and merciful. It is the image of Christ in the Gospels
that is a good many other things as well. The figure in the Gospels
does indeed utter in words of almost heart-breaking beauty his pity
for our broken hearts. But they are very far from being the only sort
of words that he utters. Nevertheless they are almost the only kind of
words that the Church in its popular imagery ever represents him as
uttering. That popular imagery is inspired by a perfectly sound popular
instinct. The mass of the poor are broken, and the mass of the people
are poor, and for the mass of mankind the main thing is to carry the
conviction of the incredible compassion of God. But nobody with his
eyes open can doubt that it is chiefly this idea of compassion that the
popular machinery of the Church does seek to carry. The popular imagery
carries a great deal to excess the sentiment of 'Gentle Jesus, meek and
mild.' It is the first thing that the outsider feels and criticises in
a Pieta or a shrine of the Sacred Heart. As I say, while the art may be
insufficient, I am not sure that the instinct is unsound. In any case
there is something appalling, something that makes the blood run cold,
in the idea of having a statue of Christ in wrath. There is something
insupportable even to the imagination in the idea of turning the corner
of a street or coming out into the spaces of a marketplace, to meet the
petrifying petrifaction of that figure as it turned upon a generation
of vipers, or that face as it looked at the face of a hypocrite. The
Church can reasonably be justified therefore if she turns the most
merciful face or aspect towards men; but it is certainly the most
merciful aspect that she does turn. And the point is here that it is
very much more specially and exclusively merciful than any impression
that could be formed by a man merely reading the New Testament for the
first time. A man simply taking the words of the story as they stand
would form quite another impression; an impression full of mystery and
possibly of inconsistency; but certainly not merely an impression of
mildness. It would be intensely interesting; but part of the interest
would consist in its leaving a good deal to be guessed at or explained.
It is full of sudden gestures evidently significant except that we
hardly know what they signify, of enigmatic silences; of ironical
replies. The outbreaks of wrath, like storms above our atmosphere,
do not seem to break out exactly where we should expect them, but to
follow some higher weather-chart of their own. The Peter whom popular
Church teaching presents is very rightly the Peter to whom Christ said
in forgiveness, 'Feed my lambs.' He is not the Peter upon whom Christ
turned as if he were the devil, crying in that obscure wrath, 'Get
thee behind me, Satan.' Christ lamented with nothing but love and pity
over Jerusalem which was to murder him. We do not know what strange
spiritual atmosphere or spiritual insight led him to sink Bethsaida
lower in the pit than Sodom. I am putting aside for the moment
all questions of doctrinal inferences or expositions, orthodox or
otherwise; I am simply imagining the effect on a man's mind if he did
really do what these critics are always talking about doing; if he did
really read the New Testament without reference to orthodoxy and even
without reference to doctrine. He would find a number of things which
fit in far less with the current unorthodoxy than they do with the
current orthodoxy. He would find, for instance, that if there are any
descriptions that deserved to be called realistic, they are precisely
the descriptions of the supernatural. If there is one aspect of the New
Testament Jesus in which he may be said to present himself eminently
as a practical person, it is in the aspect of an exorcist. There is
nothing meek and mild, there is nothing even in the ordinary sense
mystical, about the tone of the voice that says 'Hold thy peace and
come out of him.' It is much more like the tone of a very business-like
lion-tamer or a strong-minded doctor dealing with a homicidal maniac.
But this is only a side issue for the sake of illustration; I am not
now raising these controversies; but considering the case of the
imaginary man from the moon to whom the New Testament is new.

Now the first thing to note is that if we take it merely as a human
story, it is in some ways a very strange story. I do not refer here to
its tremendous and tragic culmination or to any implications involving
triumph in that tragedy. I do not refer to what is commonly called the
miraculous element; for on that point philosophies vary and modern
philosophies very decidedly waver. Indeed the educated Englishman of
to-day may be said to have passed from an old fashion, in which he
would not believe in any miracles unless they were ancient, and adopted
a new fashion in which he will not believe in any miracles unless
they are modern. He used to hold that miraculous cures stopped with
the first Christians and is now inclined to suspect that they began
with the first Christian Scientists. But I refer here rather specially
to unmiraculous and even to unnoticed and inconspicuous parts of the
story. There are a great many things about it which nobody would have
invented, for they are things that nobody has ever made any particular
use of; things which if they were remarked at all have remained rather
as puzzles. For instance, there is that long stretch of silence in
the life of Christ up to the age of thirty. It is of all silences the
most immense and imaginatively impressive. But it is not the sort
of thing that anybody is particularly likely to invent in order to
prove something; and no body so far as I know has ever tried to prove
anything in particular from it. It is impressive, but it is only
impressive as a fact; there is nothing particularly popular or obvious
about it as a fable. The ordinary trend of hero-worship and myth-making
is much more likely to say the precise opposite. It is much more likely
to say (as I believe some of the gospels rejected by the Church do
say) that Jesus displayed a divine precocity and began his mission at
a miraculously early age. And there is indeed something strange in the
thought that he who of all humanity needed least preparation seems to
have had most. Whether it was some mode of the divine humility, or
some truth of which we see the shadow of the longer domestic tutelage
of the higher creatures of the earth. I do not propose to speculate; I
mention it simply as an example of the sort of thing that does in any
case give rise to speculations, quite apart from recognised religious
speculations. Now the whole story is full of these things. It is not
by any means, as baldly presented in print, a story that it is easy to
get to the bottom of. It is anything but what these people talk of as
a simple Gospel. Relatively speaking, it is the Gospel that has the
mysticism and the Church that has the rationalism. As I should put it,
of course, it is the Gospel that is the riddle and the Church that is
the answer. But whatever be the answer, the Gospel as it stands is
almost a book of riddles.

First, a man reading the Gospel sayings would not find platitudes.
If he had read even in the most respectful spirit the majority of
ancient philosophers and of modern moralists, he would appreciate the
unique importance of saying that he did not find platitudes. It is
more than can be said even of Plato. It is much more than can be said
of Epictetus or Seneca or Marcus Aurelius or Apollonius of Tyana.
And it is immeasurably more than can be said of most of the agnostic
moralists and the preachers of the ethical societies; with their songs
of service and their religion of brotherhood. The morality of most
moralists ancient and modern, has been one solid and polished cataract
of platitudes flowing for ever and ever. That would certainly not be
the impression of the imaginary independent outsider studying the
New Testament. He would be conscious of nothing so commonplace and
in a sense of nothing so continuous as that stream. He would find a
number of strange claims that might sound like the claim to be the
brother of the sun and moon; a number of very startling pieces of
advice; a number of stunning rebukes; a number of strangely beautiful
stories. He would see some very gigantesque figures of speech about the
impossibility of threading a needle with a camel or the possibility of
throwing a mountain into the sea. He would see a number of very daring
simplifications of the difficulties of life; like the advice to shine
upon everybody indifferently as does the sunshine or not to worry
about the future any more than the birds. He would find on the other
hand some passages of almost impenetrable darkness, so far as he is
concerned, such as the moral of the parable of the Unjust Steward. Some
of these things might strike him as fables and some as truths; but none
as truisms. For instance, he would not find the ordinary platitudes in
favour of peace. He would find several paradoxes in favour of peace.
He would find several ideals of non-resistance, which taken as they
stand would be rather too pacific for any pacifist. He would be told in
one passage to treat a robber not with passive resistance, but rather
with positive and enthusiastic encouragement, if the terms be taken
literally; heaping up gifts upon the man who had stolen goods. But he
would not find a word of all that obvious rhetoric against war which
has filled countless books and odes and orations; not a word about the
wickedness of war, the wastefulness of war, the appalling scale of the
slaughter in war and all the rest of the familiar frenzy; indeed not
a word about war at all. There is nothing that throws any particular
light on Christ's attitude towards organised warfare, except that he
seems to have been rather fond of Roman soldiers. Indeed it is another
perplexity, speaking from the same external and human stand point, that
he seems to have got on much better with Romans than he did with Jews.
But the question here is a certain tone to be appreciated by merely
reading a certain text; and we might give any number of instances of it.

The statement that the meek shall inherit the earth is very far from
being a meek statement. I mean it is not meek in the ordinary sense of
mild and moderate and inoffensive. To justify it, it would be necessary
to go very deep into history and anticipate things undreamed of then
and by many unrealised even now; such as the way in which the mystical
monks reclaimed the lands which the practical kings had lost. If it was
a truth at all, it was because it was a prophecy. But certainly it was
not a truth in the sense of a truism. The blessing upon the meek would
seem to be a very violent statement; in the sense of doing violence
to reason and probability. And with this we come to another important
stage in the speculation. As a prophecy it really was fulfilled; but
it was only fulfilled long afterwards. The monasteries were the most
practical and prosperous estates and experiments in reconstruction
after the barbaric deluge; the meek did really inherit the earth.
But nobody could have known anything of the sort at the time--unless
indeed there was one who knew. Something of the same thing may be said
about the incident of Martha and Mary; which has been interpreted
in retrospect and from the inside by the mystics of the Christian
contemplative life. But it was not at all an obvious view of it; and
most moralists, ancient and modern, could be trusted to make a rush for
the obvious. What torrents of effortless eloquence would have flowed
from them to swell any slight superiority on the part of Martha; what
splendid sermons about the Joy of Service and the Gospel of Work and
the World Left Better Than We Found It, and generally all the ten
thousand platitudes that can be uttered in favour of taking trouble--by
people who need take no trouble to utter them. If in Mary the mystic
and child of love Christ was guarding the seed of something more
subtle, who was likely to understand it at the time? Nobody else could
have seen Clare and Catherine and Teresa shining above the little roof
at Bethany. It is so in another way with that magnificent menace about
bringing into the world a sword to sunder and divide. Nobody could
have guessed then either how it could be fulfilled or how it could be
justified. Indeed some freethinkers are still so simple as to fall
into the trap and be shocked at a phrase so deliberately defiant. They
actually complain of the paradox for not being a platitude.

But the point here is that if we could read the Gospel reports as
things as new as newspaper reports, they would puzzle us and perhaps
terrify us much more than the same things as developed by historical
Christianity. For instance, Christ after a clear allusion to the
eunuchs of eastern courts, said there would be eunuchs of the kingdom
of heaven. If this does not mean the voluntary enthusiasm of virginity,
it could only be made to mean something much more unnatural or uncouth.
It is the historical religion that humanises it for us by experience
of Franciscans or of Sisters of Mercy. The mere statement standing by
itself might very well suggest a rather dehumanised atmosphere; the
sinister and inhuman silence of the Asiatic harem and divan. This is
but one instance out of scores; but the moral is that the Christ of the
Gospel might actually seem more strange and terrible than the Christ of
the Church.

I am dwelling on the dark or dazzling or defiant or mysterious side of
the Gospel words, not because they had not obviously a more obvious and
popular side, but because this is the answer to a common criticism on
a vital point. The freethinker frequently says that Jesus of Nazareth
was a man of his time, even if he was in advance of his time; and that
we cannot accept his ethics as final for humanity. The freethinker
then goes on to criticise his ethics, saying plausibly enough that men
cannot turn the other cheek, or that they must take thought for the
morrow, or that the self-denial is too ascetic or the monogamy too
severe. But the Zealots and the Legionaries did not turn the other
cheek any more than we do, if so much. The Jewish traders and Roman
tax-gatherers took thought for the morrow as much as we, if not more.
We cannot pretend to be abandoning the morality of the past for one
more suited to the present. It is certainly not the morality of another
age, but it might be of another world.

In short, we can say that these ideals are impossible in themselves.
Exactly what we cannot say is that they are impossible for us. They
are rather notably marked by a mysticism which, if it be a sort of
madness, would always have struck the same sort of people as mad. Take,
for instance, the case of marriage and the relations of the sexes. It
might very well have been true that a Galilean teacher taught things
natural to a Galilean environment; but it is not. It might rationally
be expected that a man in the time of Tiberius would have advanced
a view conditioned by the time of Tiberius; but he did not. What he
advanced was something quite different; something very difficult; but
something no more difficult now than it was then. When, for instance,
Mahomet made his polygamous compromise we may reasonably say that it
was conditioned by a polygamous society. When he allowed a man four
wives he was really doing something suited to the circumstances, which
might have been less suited to other circumstances. Nobody will pretend
that the four wives were like the four winds, something seemingly a
part of the order of nature; nobody will say that the figure four was
written for ever in stars upon the sky But neither will anyone say
that the figure four is an inconceivable ideal; that it is beyond the
power of the mind of man to count up to four; or to count the number
of his wives and see whether it amounts to four. It is a practical
compromise carrying with it the character of a particular society. If
Mahomet had been born in Acton in the nineteenth century, we may well
doubt whether he would instantly have filled that suburb with harems
of four wives apiece. As he was born in Arabia in the sixth century,
he did in his conjugal arrangements suggest the conditions of Arabia
in the sixth century. But Christ in his view of marriage does not in
the least suggest the conditions of Palestine of the first century.
He does not suggest anything at all, except the sacramental view of
marriage as developed long afterwards by the Catholic Church. It was
quite as difficult for people then as for people now. It was much more
puzzling to people then than to people now. Jews and Romans and Greeks
did not believe, and did not even understand enough to disbelieve, the
mystical idea that the man and the woman had become one sacramental
substance. We may think it an incredible or impossible ideal; but we
cannot think it any more incredible or impossible than they would have
thought it. In other words, whatever else is true, it is not true
that the controversy has been altered by time. Whatever else is true,
it is emphatically not true that the ideas of Jesus of Nazareth were
suitable to his time, but are no longer suitable to our time. Exactly
how suitable they we to his time is perhaps suggested in the end of his
story.

The same truth might be stated in another way by saying that if the
story be regarded as merely human and historical, it is extraordinary
how very little there is in the recorded words of Christ that ties him
at all to his own time. I do not mean the details of a period, which
even a man of the period knows to be passing. I mean the fundamentals
which even the wisest man often vaguely assumes to be eternal. For
instance, Aristotle was perhaps the wisest and most wide-minded man who
ever lived. He founded himself entirely upon fundamentals, which have
been generally found to remain rational and solid through all social
and historical changes. Still, he lived in a world in which it was
thought as natural to have slaves as to have children. And therefore
he did permit himself a serious recognition of a difference between
slaves and free men. Christ as much as Aristotle lived in a world that
took slavery for granted. He did not particularly denounce slavery.
He started a movement that could exist in a world with slavery. But
he started a movement that could exist in a world without slavery.
He never used a phrase that made his philosophy depend even upon the
very existence of the social order in which he lived. He spoke as one
conscious that everything was ephemeral, including the things that
Aristotle thought eternal. By that time the Roman Empire had come to
be merely the orbis terrarum, another name for the world. But he never
made his morality dependent on the existence of the Roman Empire or
even on the existence of the world. 'Heaven and earth shall pass away,
but my words shall not pass away.'

The truth is that when critics have spoken of the local limitations
of the Galilean, it has always been a case of the local limitations
of the critics. He did undoubtedly believe in certain things that one
particular modern sect of materialists do not believe. But they were
not things particularly peculiar to his time. It would be nearer the
truth to say that the denial of them is quite peculiar to our time.
Doubtless it would be nearer still to the truth to say merely that a
certain solemn social importance, in the minority disbelieving them,
is peculiar to our time. He believed, for instance, in evil spirits
or in the psychic healing of bodily ills; but not because he was a
Galilean born under Augustus. It is absurd to say that a man believed
things because he was a Galilean under Augustus when he might have
believed the same things if he had been an Egyptian under Tutenkamen
or an Indian under Gengis Khan. But with this general question of the
philosophy of diabolism or of divine miracles I deal elsewhere. It is
enough to say that the materialists have to prove the impossibility
of miracles against the testimony of all mankind, not against the
prejudices of provincials in North Palestine under the first Roman
Emperors. What they have to prove, for the present argument, is the
presence in the Gospels of those particular prejudices of those
particular provincials. And, humanly speaking, it is astonishing how
little they can produce even to make a beginning of proving it.

So it is in this case of the sacrament of marriage. We may not believe
in sacraments, as we may not believe in spirits, but it is quite clear
that Christ believed in this sacrament in his own way and not in any
current or contemporary way. He certainly did not get his argument
against divorce from the Mosaic law or the Roman law or the habits of
the Palestinian people. It would appear to his critics then exactly
what it appears to his critics now; an arbitrary and transcendental
dogma coming from nowhere save in the sense that it came from him.
I am not at all concerned here to defend that dogma; the point here
is that it is just as easy to defend it now as it was to defend it
then. It is an ideal altogether outside time; difficult at any period;
impossible at no period. In other words, if anyone says it is what
might be expected of a man walking about in that place at that period,
we can quite fairly answer that it is much more like what might be the
mysterious utterance of a being beyond man, if he walked alive among
men.

I maintain therefore that a man reading the New Testament frankly and
freshly would not get the impression of what is now often meant by a
human Christ. The merely human Christ is a made-up figure, a piece of
artificial selection, like the merely evolutionary man. Moreover there
have been too many of these human Christs found in the same story,
just as there have been too many keys to mythology found in the same
stories. Three or four separate schools of rationalism have worked over
the ground and produced three or four equally rational explanations
of his life. The first rational explanation of his life was that he
never lived. And this in turn gave an opportunity for three or four
different explanations, as that he was a sun-myth or a corn-myth, or
any other kind of myth that is also a monomania. Then the idea that he
was a divine being who did not exist gave place to the idea that he
was a human being who did exist. In my youth it vas the fashion to say
that he was merely an ethical teacher in the manner of the Essenes, who
had apparently nothing very much to say that Hillel or a hundred other
Jews might not have said; as that it is a kindly thing to be kind and
an assistance to purification to be pure. Then somebody said he was a
madman with a Messianic delusion. Then others said he was indeed an
original teacher because he cared about nothing but Socialism; or (as
others said) about nothing but Pacifism. Then a more grimly scientific
character appeared who said that Jesus would never have been heard
of at all except for his prophecies of the end of the world. He was
important merely as a Millenarian like Dr. Cumming; and created a
provincial scare by announcing the exact date of the crack of doom.
Among other variants on the same theme was the theory that he was a
spiritual healer and nothing else; a view implied by Christian Science,
which has really to expound a Christianity without the Crucifixion in
order to explain the curing of Peter's wife's mother or the daughter
of a centurion. There is another theory that concentrates entirely
on the business of diabolism and what it would call the contemporary
superstition about demoniacs, as if Christ, like a young deacon taking
his first orders, had got as far as exorcism and never got any further.
Now, each of these explanations in itself seems to me singularly
inadequate; but taken together they do suggest something of the very
mystery which they miss. There must surely have been something not only
mysterious but many-sided about Christ if so many smaller Christs can
be carved out of him. If the Christian Scientist is satisfied with him
as a spiritual healer and the Christian Socialist is satisfied with him
as a social reformer, so satisfied that they do not even expect him to
be anything else, it looks as if he really covered rather more ground
than they could be expected to expect. And it does seem to suggest
that there might be more than they fancy in these other mysterious
attributes of casting out devils or prophesying doom.

Above all, would not such a new reader of the New Testament stumble
over something that would startle him much more than it startles us?
I have here more than once attempted the rather impossible task of
reversing time and the historic method; and in fancy looking forward to
the facts, instead of backward through the memories. So I have imagined
the monster that man might have seemed at first to the mere nature
around him. We should have a worse shock if we really imagined the
nature of Christ named for the first time. What should we feel at the
first whisper of a certain suggestion about a certain man? Certainly it
is not for us to blame anybody who should find that first wild whisper
merely impious and insane. On the contrary, stumbling on that rock of
scandal is the first step. Stark staring incredulity is a far more
loyal tribute to that truth than a modernist metaphysic that would make
it out merely a matter of degree. It were better to rend our robes with
a great cry against blasphemy, like Caiaphas in the judgement, or to
lay hold of the man as a maniac possessed of devils like the kinsmen
and the crowd, rather than to stand stupidly debating fine shades of
pantheism in the presence of so catastrophic a claim. There is more of
the wisdom that is one with surprise in any simple person, full of the
sensitiveness of simplicity, who should expect the grass to wither and
the birds to drop dead out of the air, when a strolling carpenter's
apprentice said calmly and almost carelessly, like one looking over his
shoulder: 'Before Abraham was, I am.'

III

THE STRANGEST STORY IN THE WORD

In the last chapter I have deliberately stressed what seems to be
nowadays a neglected side of the New Testament story, but nobody will
suppose, I imagine, that it is meant to obscure that side that may
truly be called human. That Christ was and is the most merciful of
judges and the most sympathetic of friends is a fact of considerably
more importance in our own private lives than in anybody's historical
speculations. But the purpose of this book is to point out that
something unique has been swamped in cheap generalisations; and for
that purpose it is relevant to insist that even what was most universal
was also most original. For instance, we might take a topic which
really is sympathetic to the modern mood, as the ascetic vocations
recently referred to are not. The exaltation of childhood is something
which we do really understand; but it was by no means a thing that
was then in that sense understood. If we wanted an example of the
originality of the Gospels we could hardly take a stronger or more
startling one. Nearly two thousand years afterwards we happen to find
ourselves in a mood that does really feel the mystical charm of the
child; we express it in romances and regrets about childhood, in Peter
Pan or The Child's Garden of verses. And we can say of the words of
Christ with so angry an anti-Christian as Swinburne:--

'No sign that ever was given To faithful or faithless eyes Showed ever
beyond clouds riven So clear a paradise.

Earth's creeds may be seventy times seven And blood have defiled each
creed But if such be the kingdom of heaven It must be heaven indeed.'

But that paradise was not clear until Christianity had gradually
cleared it. The pagan world, as such, would not have understood any
such thing as a serious suggestion that a child is higher or holier
than a man. It would have seemed like the suggestion that a tadpole
is higher or holier than a frog. To the merely rationalistic mind, it
would sound like saying that a bud must be more beautiful than a flower
or that an unripe apple must be better than a ripe one. In other words,
this modern feeling is an entirely mystical feeling. It is quite as
mystical as the cult of virginity; in fact it is the cult of virginity.
But pagan antiquity had much more idea of the holiness of the virgin
than of the holiness of the child. For various reasons we have come
nowadays to venerate children, perhaps partly because we envy children
for still doing what men used to do; such as play simple games and
enjoy fairy-tales. Over and above this, however, there is a great deal
of real and subtle psychology in our appreciation of childhood; but if
we turn it into a modern discovery, we must once more admit that the
historical Jesus of Nazareth had already discovered it two thousand
years too soon. There was certainly nothing in the world around him to
help him to the discovery. Here Christ was indeed human; but more human
than a human being was then likely to be. Peter Pan does not belong to
the world of Pan but the world of Peter.

Even in the matter of mere literary style, if we suppose ourselves thus
sufficiently detached to look at it in that light, there is a curious
quality to which no critic seems to have done justice. It had among
other things a singular air of piling tower upon tower by the use of
the a fortiori; making a pagoda of degrees like the seven heavens.
I have already noted that almost inverted imaginative vision which
pictured the impossible penance of the Cities of the Plain. There is
perhaps nothing so perfect in all language or literature as the use
of these three degrees in the parable of the lilies of the field; in
which he seems first to take one small flower in his hand and note
its simplicity and even its impotence; then suddenly expands it in
flamboyant colours into all the palaces and pavilions full of a great
name in national legend and national glory; and then, by yet a third
overturn, shrivels into nothing once more with a gesture as if flinging
it away ``and if God so clothes the grass that today is and tomorrow is
cast into the oven--how much more'' It is like the building of a good
Babel tower by white magic in a moment and in the movement of a hand; a
tower heaved suddenly up to heaven on the top of which can be seen afar
off, higher than we had fancied possible, the figure of man; lifted by
three infinities above all other things, on a starry ladder of light
logic and swift imagination. Merely in a literary sense it would be
more of a masterpiece than most of the masterpieces in the libraries;
yet it seems to have been uttered almost at random while a man might
pull a flower. But merely in a literary sense also, this use of the
comparative in several degrees has about it a quality which seems to me
to hint of much higher things than the modern suggestion of the simple
teaching of pastoral or communal ethics. There is nothing that really
indicates a subtle and in the true sense a superior mind so much as
this power of comparing a lower thing with a higher and yet that higher
with a higher still; of thinking on three planes at once. There is
nothing that wants the rarest sort of wisdom so much as to see, let us
say, that the citizen is higher than the slave and yet that the soul is
infinitely higher than the citizen or the city. It is not by any means
a faculty that commonly belongs to these simplifiers of the Gospel;
those who insist on what they call a simple morality and others call a
sentimental morality. It is not at all covered by those who are content
to tell everybody to remain at peace. On the contrary, there is a very
striking example of it in the apparent inconsistency between Christ's
sayings about peace and about a sword. It is precisely this power which
perceives that while a good peace is better than a good war, even a
good war is better than a bad peace. These far-flung comparisons are
nowhere so common as in the Gospels; and to me they suggest something
very vast. So a thing solitary and solid, with the added dimension of
depth or height, might tower over the flat creatures living only on a
plane.

This quality of something that can only be called subtle and superior,
something that is capable of long views and even of double meanings,
is not noted here merely as a counterblast to the commonplace
exaggerations of amiability and mild idealism. It is also to be noted
in connection with the more tremendous truth touched upon at the end
of the last chapter. For this is the very last character that commonly
goes with mere megalomania; especially such steep and staggering
megalomania as might be involved in that claim. This quality that can
only be called intellectual distinction is not, of course, an evidence
of divinity. But it is an evidence of a probable distaste for vulgar
and vainglorious claims to divinity. A man of that sort, if he were
only a man, would be the last man in the world to suffer from that
intoxication by one notion from nowhere in particular, which is the
mark of the self-deluding sensationalist in religion. Nor is it even
avoided by denying that Christ did make this claim. Of no such man
as that, of no other prophet or philosopher of the same intellectual
order, would it be even possible to pretend that he had made it. Even
if the Church had mistaken his meaning, it would still be true that no
other historical tradition except the Church had ever even made the
same mistake. Mahomedans did not misunderstand Mahomet and suppose
he was Allah. Jews did not misinterpret Moses and identify him with
Jehovah. Why was this claim alone exaggerated unless this alone was
made. Even if Christianity was one vast universal blunder, it is still
a blunder as solitary as the Incarnation.

The purpose of these pages is to fix the falsity of certain vague and
vulgar assumptions; and we have here one of the most false. There is
a sort of notion in the air everywhere that all the religions are
equal because all the religious founders were rivals, that they are
all fighting for the same starry crown. It is quite false. The claim
to that crown, or anything like that crown, is really so rare as to
be unique. Mahomet did not make it any more than Micah or Malachi.
Confucius did not make it any more that Plato or Marcus Aurelius.
Buddha never said he was Bramah. Zoroaster no more claimed to be Ormuz
than to be Ahriman. The truth is that, in the common run of cases, it
is just as we should expect it to be, in common sense and certainly in
Christian philosophy. It is exactly the other way. Normally speaking,
the greater a man is, the less likely he is to make the very greatest
claim. Outside the unique case we are considering, the only kind of man
who ever does make that kind of claim is a very small man; a secretive
or self-centered monomaniac. Nobody can imagine Aristotle claiming to
be the father of gods and men, come down from the sky; though we might
imagine some insane Roman Emperor like Caligula claiming it for him, or
more probably for himself. Nobody can imagine Shakespeare talking as if
he were literally divine; though we might imagine some crazy American
crank finding it as a cryptogram in Shakespeare's works, or preferably
in his own works. It is possible to find here and there human beings
who make this supremely superhuman claim. It is possible to find them
in lunatic asylums; in padded cells; possibly in strait waistcoats.
But what is much more important than their mere materialistic fate
in our very materialistic society, under very crude and clumsy laws
about lunacy, the type we know as tinged with this, or tending towards
it, is a diseased and disproportionate type; narrow yet swollen and
morbid to monstrosity. It is by rather an unlucky metaphor that we
talk of a madman as cracked; for in a sense he is not cracked enough.
He is cramped rather than cracked; there are not enough holes in his
head to ventilate it. This impossibility of letting in daylight on a
delusion does sometimes cover and conceal a delusion of divinity. It
can be found, not among prophets and sages and founders of religions,
but only among a low set of lunatics. But this is exactly where the
argument becomes intensely interesting; because the argument proves
too much. For nobody supposes that Jesus of Nazareth was that sort of
person. No modern critic in his five wits thinks that the preacher of
the Sermon on the Mount was a horrible half-witted imbecile that might
be scrawling stars on the walls of a cell. No atheist or blasphemer
believes that the author of the Parable of the Prodigal Son was a
monster with one mad idea like a cyclops with one eye. Upon any
possible historical criticism, he must be put higher in the scale of
human beings than that. Yet by all analogy we have really to put him
there or else in the highest place of all.

In, fact, those who can really take it (as I here hypothetically take
it) in a quite dry and detached spirit, have here a most curious and
interesting human problem. It is so intensely interesting, considered
as a human problem, that it is in a spirit quite disinterested, so
to speak, that I wish some of them had turned that intricate human
problem into something like an intelligible human portrait. If Christ
was simply a human character, he really was a highly complex and
contradictory human character. For he combined exactly the two things
that lie at the two extremes of human variation. He was exactly what
the man with a delusion never is; he was wise; he was a good judge.
What he said was always unexpected; but it was always unexpectedly
magnanimous and often unexpectedly moderate. Take a thing like the
point of the parable of the tares and the wheat. It has the quality
that unites sanity and subtlety. It has not the simplicity of a
madman. It has not even the simplicity of a fanatic. It might be
uttered by a philosopher a hundred years old, at the end of a century
of Utopias. Nothing could be less like this quality of seeing beyond
and all round obvious things, than the condition of the egomaniac
with the one sensitive spot on his brain. I really do not see how
these two characters could be convincingly combined, except in the
astonishing way in which the creed combines them. For until we reach
the full acceptance of the fact as a fact, however marvellous, all
mere approximations to it are actually further and further away from
it. Divinity is great enough to be divine; it is great enough to call
itself divine. But as humanity grows greater, it grows less and less
likely to do so. God is God, as the Moslems say; but a great man knows
he is not God, and the greater he is the better he knows it. That is
the paradox; everything that is merely approaching to that point is
merely receding from it. Socrates, the wisest man, knows that he knows
nothing. A lunatic may think he is omniscience, and a fool may talk as
if he were omniscient. But Christ is in another sense omniscient if he
not only knows, but knows that he knows.

Even on the purely human and sympathetic side, therefore, the Jesus of
the New Testament seems to me to have in a great many ways the note of
something superhuman; that is of something human and more than human.
But there is another quality running through all his teachings which
seems to me neglected in most modern talk about them as teachings; and
that is the persistent suggestion that he has not really come to teach.
If there is one incident in the record which affects me personally as
grandly and gloriously human, it is the incident of giving wine for
the wedding-feast. That is really human in the sense in which a whole
crowd of prigs, having the appearance of human beings, can hardly
be described as human. It rises superior to all superior persons.
It is as human as Herrick and as democratic as Dickens. But even in
that story there is something else that has that note of things not
fully explained; and in a way here very relevant. I mean the first
hesitation, not on any ground touching the nature of the miracle, but
on that of the propriety of working any miracles at all, at least at
that stage; 'my time is not yet come.' What does that mean? At least
it certainly meant a general plan or purpose in the mind, with which
certain things did or did not fit in. And if we leave out that solitary
strategic plan, we not only leave out the point of the story, but the
story.

We often hear of Jesus of Nazareth as a wandering teacher, and there
is a vital truth in that view in so far as it emphasises an attitude
towards luxury and convention which most respectable people would still
regard as that of a vagabond. It is expressed in his own great saying
about the holes of the foxes and the nests of the birds, and, like many
of his great sayings, it is felt as less powerful than it is, through
lack of appreciation of that great paradox by which he spoke of his
own humanity as in some way collectively and representatively human;
calling himself simply the Son of Man; that is, in effect, calling
himself simply Man. It is fitting that the New Man or the Second Adam
should repeat in so ringing a voice and with so arresting a gesture the
great fact which came first in the original story, that man differs
from the brutes by everything, even by deficiency; that he is in a
sense less normal and even less native; a stranger upon the earth. It
is well to speak of his wanderings in this sense and in the sense that
he shared the drifting life of the most homeless and hopeless of the
poor. It is assuredly well to remember that he would quite certainly
have been moved on by the police and almost certainly arrested by the
police for having no visible means of subsistence. For our law has
in it a turn of humour or touch of fancy which Nero and Herod never
happened to think of, that of actually punishing homeless people for
not sleeping at home.

But in another sense the word 'wandering' as applied to his life is
a little misleading. As a matter of fact, a great many of the pagan
sages and not a few of the pagan sophists might truly be described as
wandering teachers. In some of them their rambling journeys were not
altogether without a parallel in their rambling remarks. Apollonius
of Tyana, who figured in some fashionable cults as a sort of ideal
philosopher, is represented as rambling as far as the Ganges and
Ethiopia, more or less talking all the time. There was actually a
school of philosophers called the Peripatetics; and most even of the
great philosophers give us a vague impression of having very little to
do except to walk and talk. The great conversations which give us our
glimpses of the great minds of Socrates or Buddha or even Confucius
often seem to be parts of a never-ending picnic; and especially, which
is the important point, to have neither beginning nor end. Socrates
did indeed find the conversation interrupted by the incident of his
execution. But it is the whole point and the whole particular merit,
of the position of Socrates that death was only an interruption and an
incident. We miss the real moral importance of the great philosopher if
we miss that point; that he stares at the executioner with an innocent
surprise, and almost an innocent annoyance, at finding anyone so
unreasonable as to cut short a little conversation for the elucidation
of truth. He is looking for truth and not looking for death. Death is
but a stone in the road which can trip him up. His work in life is
to wander on the roads of the world and talk about truth for ever.
Buddha, on the other hand, did arrest attention by one gesture; it
was the gesture of renunciation, and therefore in a sense of denial.
But by one dramatic negation he passed into a world of negation that
was not dramatic; which he would have been the first to insist was
not dramatic. Here again we miss the particular moral importance of
the great mystic if we do not see the distinction; that it was his
whole point that he had done with drama, which consists of desire and
struggle and generally of defeat and disappointment. He passes into
peace and lives to instruct others how to pass into it. Henceforth his
life is that of the ideal philosopher; certainly a far more really
ideal philosopher than Apollonius of Tyana; but still a philosopher
in the sense that it is not his business to do anything but rather to
explain everything; in his case, we might almost say, mildly and softly
to explore everything. For the messages are basically different. Christ
said 'Seek first the kingdom, and all these things shall be added unto
you.' Buddha said 'Seek first the kingdom, and then you will need none
of these things.'

Now compared to these wanderers the life of Jesus went as swift and
straight as a thunderbolt. It was above all things dramatic; it did
above all things consist in doing something that had to be done. It
emphatically would not have been done, if Jesus had walked about
the world for ever doing nothing except tell the truth. And even
the external movement of it must not be described as a wandering in
the sense of forgetting that it was a journey. This is where it was
a fulfilment of the myths rather than of the philosophies; it is a
journey with a goal and an object, like Jason going to find the Golden
Fleece, or Hercules the golden apples of the Hesperides. The gold that
he was seeking was death. The primary thing that he was going to do was
to die. He was going to do other things equally definite and objective;
we might almost say equally external and material. But from first to
last the most definite fact is that he is going to die. No two things
could possibly be more different than the death of Socrates and the
death of Christ. We are meant to feel that the death of Socrates was,
from the point of view of his friends at least, a stupid muddle and
miscarriage of justice interfering with the flow of a humane and lucid,
I had almost said a light philosophy. We are meant to feel that Death
was the bride of Christ as Poverty was the bride of St. Francis. We are
meant to feel that his life was in that sense a sort of love-affair
with death, a romance of the pursuit of the ultimate sacrifice. From
the moment when the star goes up like a birthday rocket to the moment
when the sun is extinguished like a funeral torch, the whole story
moves on wings with the speed and direction of a drama, ending in an
act beyond words.

Therefore the story of Christ is the story of a journey, almost in
the manner of a military march; certainly in the manner of the quest
of a hero moving to his achievement or his doom. It is a story that
begins in the paradise of Galilee, a pastoral and peaceful land having
really some hint of Eden, and gradually climbs the rising country into
the mountains that are nearer to the storm-clouds and the stars, as
to a Mountain of Purgatory. He may be met as if straying in strange
places, or stopped on the way for discussion or dispute; but his face
is set towards the mountain city. That is the meaning of that great
culmination when he crested the ridge and stood at the turning of the
road and suddenly cried aloud, lamenting over Jerusalem. Some light
touch of that lament is in every patriotic poem; or if it is absent,
the patriotism stinks with vulgarity. That is the meaning the stirring
and startling incident at the gates of the Temple, when the tables
were hurled like lumber down the steps, and the rich merchants driven
forth with bodily blows; the incident that must be at least as much of
a puzzle to the pacifists as any paradox about non resistance can be
to any of the militarists. I have compared the quest to the journey of
Jason, but we must never forget that in a deeper sense it is rather
to be compared to the journey of Ulysses. It was not only a romance
of travel but a romance of return; and of the end of a usurpation.
No healthy boy reading the story regards the rout of the Ithacan
suitors as anything but a happy ending. But there are doubtless some
who regard the rout of the Jewish merchants and money changers with
that refined repugnance which never fails to move them in the presence
of violence, and especially of violence against the well-to-do. The
point, here however, is that all these incidents have in them a
character of mounting crisis. In other words, these incidents are not
incidental. When Apollonius the ideal philosopher is brought before
the judgement-seat of Domitian and vanishes by magic, the miracle
is entirely incidental. It might have occurred at any time in the
wandering life of the Tyanean; indeed, I believe it is doubtful in date
as well as in substance. The ideal philosopher merely vanished, and
resumed his ideal existence somewhere else for an indefinite period. It
is characteristic of the contrast perhaps that Apollonius was supposed
to have lived to an almost miraculous old age. Jesus of Nazareth
was less prudent in his miracles. When Jesus was brought before the
judgement-seat of Pontius Pilate, he did not vanish. It was the crisis
and the goal; it was the hour and the power of darkness. It was the
supremely supernatural act, of all his miraculous life, that he did not
vanish.

Every attempt to amplify that story has diminished it. The task has
been attempted by many men of real genius and eloquence as well as by
only too many vulgar sentimentalists and self-conscious rhetoricians.
The tale has been retold with patronising pathos by elegant sceptics
and with fluent enthusiasm by boisterous best-sellers. It will not be
retold here. The grinding power of the plain words of the Gospel story
is like the power of mill-stones; and those who can read them simply
enough will feel as if rocks had been rolled upon them. Criticism is
only words about words; and of what use are words about such words as
these? What is the use of word-painting about the dark garden filled
suddenly with torchlight and furious faces? 'Are you come out with
swords and staves as against a robber? All day I sat in your temple
teaching, and you took me not.' Can anything be added to the massive
and gathered restraint of that irony; like a great wave lifted to the
sky and refusing to fall? 'Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me
but weep for yourselves and for your children.' As the High Priest
asked what further need he had of witnesses, we might well ask what
further need we have of words. Peter in a panic repudiated him: 'and
immediately the cock crew; and Jesus looked upon Peter, and Peter went
out and wept bitterly.' Has anyone any further remarks to offer. Just
before the murder he prayed for all the murderous race of men, saying,
'They know not what they do'; is there anything to say to that, except
that we know as little what we say? Is there any need to repeat and
spin out the story of how the tragedy trailed up the Via Dolorosa and
how they threw him in haphazard with two thieves in one of the ordinary
batches of execution; and how in all that horror and howling wilderness
of desertion one voice spoke in homage, a startling voice from the very
last place where it was looked for, the gibbet of the criminal; and he
said to that nameless ruffian, 'This night shalt thou be with me in
Paradise'? Is there anything to put after that but a full stop? Or is
anyone prepared to answer adequately that farewell gesture to all flesh
which created for his Mother a new Son?

It is more within my powers, and here more immediately to my purpose,
to point out that in that scene were symbolically gathered all the
human forces that have been vaguely sketched in this story. As kings
and philosophers and the popular element had been symbolically present
at his birth, so they were more practically concerned in his death; and
with that we come face to face with the essential fact to be realised.
All the great groups that stood about the Cross represent in one way
or another the great historical truth of the time; that the world
could not save itself. Man could do no more. Rome and Jerusalem and
Athens and everything else were going down like a sea turned into a
slow cataract. Externally indeed the ancient world was still at its
strongest; it is always at that moment that the inmost weakness begins.
But in order to understand that weakness we must repeat what has been
said more than once; that it was not the weakness of a thing originally
weak. It was emphatically the strength of the world that was turned to
weakness and the wisdom of the world that was turned to folly.

In this story of Good Friday it is the best things in the world that
are at their worst. That is what really shows us the world at its
worst. It was, for instance, the priests of a true monotheism and the
soldiers of an international civilisation. Rome, the legend, founded
upon fallen Troy and triumphant over fallen Carthage, had stood for a
heroism which was the nearest that any pagan ever came to chivalry.
Rome had defended the household gods and the human decencies against
the ogres of Africa and the hermaphrodite monstrosities of Greece.
But in the lightning flash of this incident, we see great Rome, the
imperial republic, going downward under her Lucretian doom. Scepticism
has eaten away even the confident sanity of the conquerors of the
world. He who is enthroned to say what is justice can only ask: 'What
is truth?' So in that drama which decided the whole fate of antiquity,
one of the central figures is fixed in what seems the reverse of his
true role. Rome was almost another name for responsibility. Yet he
stands for ever as a sort of rocking statue of the irresponsible. Man
could do no more. Even the practical had become the impracticable.
Standing between the pillars of his own judgement-seat, a Roman had
washed his hands of the world.

There too were the priests of that pure and original truth that was
behind all the mythologies like the sky behind the clouds. It was the
most important truth in the world; and even that could not save the
world. Perhaps there is something overpowering in pure personal theism;
like seeing the sun and moon and sky come together to form one staring
face. Perhaps the truth is too tremendous when not broken by some
intermediaries divine or human; perhaps it is merely too pure and far
away. Anyhow it could not save the world; it could not even conquer
the world. There were philosophers who held it in its highest and
noblest form; but they not only could not convert the world, but they
never tried. You could no more fight the jungle of popular mythology
with a private opinion than you could clear away a forest with a
pocket-knife. The Jewish priests had guarded it jealously in the good
and the bad sense. They had kept it as a gigantic secret. As savage
heroes might have kept the sun in a box, they kept the Everlasting in
the tabernacle. They were proud that they alone could look upon the
blinding sun of a single deity; and they did not know that they had
themselves gone blind. Since that day their representatives have been
like blind men in broad daylight, striking to right and left with their
staffs, and cursing the darkness. But there has been that in their
monumental monotheism that it has at least remained like a monument,
the last thing of its kind, and in a sense motionless in the more
restless world which it cannot satisfy. For it is certain that for some
reason it cannot satisfy. Since that day it has never been quite enough
to say that God is in his heaven and all is right with the world, since
the rumour that God had left his heavens to set it right.

And as it was with these powers that were good, or at least had once
been good, so it was with the element which was perhaps the best, or
which Christ himself seems certainly to have felt as the best. The poor
to whom he preached the good news, the common people who heard him
gladly, the populace that had made so many popular heroes and demigods
in the old pagan world, showed also the weaknesses that were dissolving
the world. They suffered the evils often seen in the mob of the city,
and especially the mob of the capital, during the decline of a society.
The same thing that makes the rural population live on tradition makes
the urban population live on rumour. Just as its myths at the best
had been irrational, so its likes and dislikes are easily changed by
baseless assertion that is arbitrary without being authoritative.
Some brigand or other was artificially turned into a picturesque and
popular figure and run as a kind of candidate against Christ. In all
this we recognise the urban population that we know, with its newspaper
scares and scoops. But there was present in this ancient population
an evil more peculiar to the ancient world. We have noted it already
as the neglect of the individual, even of the individual voting the
condemnation and still more of the individual condemned. It was the
soul of the hive; a heathen thing. The cry of this spirit also was
heard in that hour, 'It is well that one man die for the people.' Yet
this spirit in antiquity of devotion to the city and to the state had
also been in itself and in its time a noble spirit. It had its poets
and its martyrs; men still to be honoured for ever. It was failing
through its weakness in not seeing the separate soul of a man, the
shrine of all mysticism; but it was only failing as everything else
was failing. The mob went along with the Sadducees and the Pharisees,
the philosophers and the moralists. It went along with the imperial
magistrates and the sacred priests, the scribes and the soldiers, that
the one universal human spirit might suffer a universal condemnation;
that there might be one deep, unanimous chorus of approval and harmony
when Man was rejected of men.

There were solitudes beyond where none shall follow. There were secrets
in the inmost and invisible part of that drama that have no symbol in
speech; or in any severance of a man from men. Nor is it easy for any
words less stark and single-minded than those of the naked narrative
even to hint at the horror of exaltation that lifted itself above the
hill. Endless expositions have not come to the end of it, or even to
the beginning. And if there be any sound that can produce a silence, we
may surely be silent about the end and the extremity; when a cry was
driven out of that darkness in words dreadfully distinct and dreadfully
unintelligible, which man shall never understand in all the eternity
they have purchased for him; and for one annihilating instant an abyss
that is not for our thoughts had opened even in the unity of the
absolute; and God had been forsaken of God.

They took the body down from the cross and one of the few rich men
among the first Christians obtained permission to bury it in a rock
tomb in his garden; the Romans setting a military guard lest there
should be some riot and attempt to recover the body. There was once
more a natural symbolism in these natural proceedings; it was well
that the tomb should be sealed with all the secrecy of ancient eastern
sepulture and guarded by the authority of the Caesars. For in that
second cavern the whole of that great and glorious humanity which we
call antiquity was gathered up and covered over; and in that place it
was buried. It was the end of a very great thing called human history;
the history that was merely human. The mythologies and the philosophies
were buried there, the gods and the heroes and the sages. In the great
Roman phrase, they had lived. But as they could only live, so they
could only die; and they were dead.

On the third day the friends of Christ coming at daybreak to the place
found the grave empty and the stone rolled away. In varying ways they
realised the new wonder; but even they hardly realised that the world
had died in the night. What they were looking at was the first day of
a new creation, with a new heaven and a new earth; and in a semblance
of the gardener God walked again in the garden, in the cool not of the
evening but the dawn.

IV

THE WITNESS OF THE HERETICS

Christ founded the Church with two great figures of speech; in the
final words to the Apostles who received authority to found it. The
first was the phrase about founding it on Peter as on a rock; the
second was the symbol of the keys. About the meaning of the former
there is naturally no doubt in my own case; but it does not directly
affect the argument here save in two more secondary aspects. It is yet
another example of a thing that could only fully expand and explain
itself afterwards, and even long afterwards. And it is yet another
example of something the very reverse of simple and self-evident even
in the language, in so far as it described a man as a rock when he had
much more the appearance of a reed.

But the other image of the keys has an exactitude that has hardly been
exactly noticed. The keys have been conspicuous enough in the art
and heraldry of Christendom; but not everyone has noted the peculiar
aptness of the allegory. We have now reached the point in history where
something must be said of the first appearance and activities of the
Church in the Roman Empire; and for that brief description nothing
could be more perfect than that ancient metaphor. The Early Christian
was very precisely a person carrying about a key, or what he said was a
key. The whole Christian movement consisted in claiming to possess that
key. It was not merely a vague forward movement, which might be better
represented by a battering-ram. It was not something that swept along
with it similar or dissimilar things, as does a modern social movement.
As we shall see in a moment, it rather definitely refused to do so. It
definitely asserted that there was a key and that it possessed that key
and that no other key was like it; in that sense it was as narrow as
you please. Only it happened to be the key that could unlock the prison
of the whole world; and let in the white daylight of liberty.

The creed was like a key in three respects; which can be most
conveniently summed up under this symbol. First, a key is above all
things a thing with a shape It is a thing that depends entirely
upon keeping its shape. The Christian creed is above all things the
philosophy of shapes and the enemy of shapelessness. That is where it
differs from all that formless infinity, Manichean or Buddhist, which
makes a sort of pool of night in the dark heart of Asia; the ideal
of uncreating all the creatures. That is where it differs also from
the analogous vagueness of mere evolutionism, the idea of creatures
constantly losing their shape. A man told that his solitary latchkey
had been melted down with a million others into a Buddhistic unity
would be annoyed. But a man told that his key was gradually growing and
sprouting in his pocket, and branching into new wards or complications,
would not be more gratified.

Second, the shape of a key is in itself a rather fantastic shape. A
savage who did not know it was a key would have the greatest difficulty
in guessing what it could possibly be. And it is fantastic because it
is in a sense arbitrary. A key is not a matter of abstractions; in that
sense a key is not a matter of argument. It either fits the lock or it
does not. It is useless for men to stand disputing over it, considered
by itself; or reconstructing it on pure principles of geometry or
decorative art. It is senseless for a man to say he would like a simple
key; it would be far more sensible to do his best with a crowbar. And
thirdly, as the key is necessarily a thing with a pattern, so this
was one having in some ways a rather elaborate pattern. When people
complain of the religion being so early complicated with theology
and things of the kind, they forget that the world had not only got
into a hole, but had got into a whole maze of holes and corners. The
problem itself was a complicated problem; it did not in the ordinary
sense merely involve anything so simple as sin. It was also full of
secrets, of unexplored and unfathomable fallacies, of unconscious
mental diseases, of dangers in all directions. If the faith had faced
the world only with the platitudes about peace and simplicity some
moralists would confine it to, it would not have had the faintest
effect on that luxurious and labyrinthine lunatic asylum. What it did
do we must now roughly describe; it is enough to say here that there
was undoubtedly much about the key that seemed complex, indeed there
was only one thing about it that was simple. It opened the door.

There are certain recognised and accepted statements in this matter
which may for brevity and convenience be described as lies. We have
all heard people say that Christianity arose in an age of barbarism.
They might just as well say that Christian Science arose in an age
of barbarism. They may think Christianity was a symptom of social
decay, as I think Christian Science a symptom of mental decay. They
may think Christianity a superstition that ultimately destroyed a
civilisation, as I think Christian Science a superstition capable (if
taken seriously) of destroying any number of civilisations. But to
say that a Christian of the fourth or fifth centuries was a barbarian
living in a barbarous time is exactly like saying that Mrs. Eddy was
a Red Indian. And if I allowed my constitutional impatience with Mrs.
Eddy to impel me to call her a Red Indian, I should incidentally be
telling a lie. We may like or dislike the imperial civilisation of
Rome in the fourth century; we may like or dislike the industrial
civilisation of America in the nineteenth century; but that they both
were what we commonly mean by a civilisation no person of commonsense
could deny if he wanted to. This is a very obvious fact but it is
also a very fundamental one; and we must make it the foundation of
any further description of constructive Christianity in the past. For
good or evil, it was pre-eminently the product of a civilised age,
perhaps of an over-civilised age. This is the first fact apart from
all praise or blame; indeed I am so unfortunate as not to feel that I
praise a thing when I compare it to Christian Science. But it is at
least desirable to know something of the savour of a society in which
we are condemning or praising anything; and the science that connects
Mrs. Eddy with tomahawks or the Mater Dolorosa with totems may for
our general convenience be eliminated. The dominant fact, not merely
about the Christian religion, but about the whole pagan civilisation,
was that which has been more than once repeated in these pages. The
Mediterranean was a lake in the real sense of a pool; in which a number
of different cults or cultures were, as the phrase goes, pooled. Those
cities facing each other round the circle of the lake became more
and more one cosmopolitan culture. On its legal and military side it
was the Roman Empire, but it was very many-sided. It might be called
superstitious in the sense that it contained a great number of varied
superstitions; but by no possibility can any part of it be called
barbarous.

In this level of cosmopolitan culture arose the Christian religion
and the Catholic Church; and everything in the story suggests that
it was felt to be something new and strange. Those who have tried
to suggest that it evolved out of something much milder or more
ordinary have found that in this case their evolutionary method is
very difficult to apply. They may suggest that Essenes or Ebionites
or such things were the seed; but the seed is invisible; the tree
appears very rapidly full-grown; and the tree is something totally
different. It is certainly a Christmas tree in the sense that it keeps
the kindliness and moral beauty of the story of Bethlehem; but it was
as ritualistic as the seven-branched candlestick, and the candles it
carried were considerably more than were probably permitted by the
first prayer-book of Edward the Sixth. It might well be asked, indeed,
why any one accepting the Bethlehem tradition should object to golden
or gilded ornament since the Magi themselves brought gold, why he
should dislike incense in the church since incense was brought even to
the stable. But these are controversies that do not concern me here. I
am concerned only with the historical fact, more and more admitted by
historians, that very early in its history this thing became visible to
the civilisation of antiquity; and that already the Church appeared as
a Church; with everything that is implied in a Church and much that is
disliked in a Church. We will discuss in a moment how far it was like
other ritualistic or magical or ascetical mysteries in its own time.
It was certainly not in the least like merely ethical and idealistic
movements in our time. It had a doctrine; it had a discipline; it
had sacraments; it had degrees of initiation, it admitted people and
expelled people; it affirmed one dogma with authority and repudiated
another with anathemas. If all these things be the marks of Antichrist,
the reign of Antichrist followed very rapidly upon Christ.

Those who maintain that Christianity was not a Church but a moral
movement of idealists have been forced to push the period of its
perversion or disappearance further and further back. A bishop of
Rome writes claiming authority in the very lifetime of St. John the
Evangelist; and it is described as the first papal aggression. A friend
of the Apostles writes of them as men he knew and says they taught
him the doctrine of the Sacrament, and Mr. Wells can only murmur that
the reaction towards barbaric blood-rites may have happened rather
earlier than might be expected. The date of the Fourth Gospel, which
at one time was steadily growing later and later, is now steadily
growing earlier and earlier; until critics are staggered at the dawning
and dreadful possibility that it might be something like what it
professes to be. The last limit of an early date for the extinction
of true Christianity has probably been found by the latest German
professor whose authority is invoked by Dean Inge. This learned scholar
says that Pentecost was the occasion for the first founding of an
ecclesiastical, dogmatic, and despotic Church utterly alien to the
simple ideals of Jesus of Nazareth. This may be called, in a popular
as well as a learned sense, the limit. What do professors of this kind
imagine that men are made of? Suppose it were a matter of any merely
human movement, let us say that of the conscientious objectors. Some
say the early Christians were Pacifists; I do not believe it for a
moment; but I am quite ready to accept the parallel for the sake of
the argument. Tolstoy or some great preacher of peace among peasants
has been shot as a mutineer for defying conscription; and a little
while afterwards his few followers meet together in an upper room in
remembrance of him. They never had any reason for coming together
except that common memory; they are men of many kinds with nothing to
bind them, except that the greatest event in all their lives was this
tragedy of the teacher of universal peace. They are always repeating
his words, revolving his problems, trying to imitate his character. The
Pacifists meet at their Pentecost and are possessed of a sudden ecstasy
of enthusiasm and wild rush of the whirlwind of inspiration, in the
course of which they proceed to establish universal Conscription, to
increase the Navy Estimates, to insist on everybody going about armed
to the teeth and on all the frontiers bristling with artillery; the
proceedings concluded with the singing of 'Boys of the Bulldog Breed'
and 'Don't let them scrap the British Navy.' That is something like a
fair parallel to the theory of these critics; that the transition from
their idea of Jesus to their idea of Catholicism could have been made
in the little upper room at Pentecost. Surely anybody's commonsense
would tell him that enthusiasts who only met through their common
enthusiasm for a leader whom they loved, would not instantly rush away
to establish everything that he hated. No, if the 'ecclesiastical and
dogmatic system' is as old as Pentecost it is as old as Christmas. If
we trace it back to such very early Christians we must trace it back to
Christ.

We may begin then with these two negations. It is nonsense to say
that the Christian faith appeared in a simple age; in the sense of
an unlettered and gullible age. It is equally nonsense to say that
the Christian faith was a simple thing; in the sense of a vague or
childish or merely instinctive thing. Perhaps the only point in which
we could possibly say that the Church fitted into the pagan world,
is the fact that they were both not only highly civilised but rather
complicated. They were both emphatically many-sided; but antiquity was
then a many-sided hole, like a hexagonal hole waiting for an equally
hexagonal stopper. In that sense only the Church was many-sided enough
to fit the world. The six sides of the Mediterranean world faced each
other across the sea and waited for something that should look all
ways at once. The Church had to be both Roman and Greek and Jewish and
African and Asiatic. In the very words of the Apostle of the Gentiles,
it was indeed all things to all men. Christianity then was not merely
crude and simple and was the very reverse of the growth of a barbaric
time. But when we come to the contrary charge, we come to a much more
plausible charge. It is very much more tenable that the Faith was but
the final phase of the decay of civilisation, in the sense of the
excess of civilisation; that this superstition was a sign that Rome was
dying, and dying of being much too civilised. That is an argument much
better worth considering; and we will proceed to consider it.

At the beginning of this book I ventured on a general summary of it,
in a parallel between the rise of humanity out of nature and the rise
of Christianity out of history. I pointed out that in both cases what
had gone before might imply something coming after; but did not in the
least imply what did come after. If a detached mind had seen certain
apes it might have deduced more anthropoids; it would not have deduced
man or anything within a thousand miles of what man has done. In
short, it might have seen Pithecanthropus or the Missing Link looming
in the future, if possible almost as dimly and doubtfully as we see
him looming in the past. But if it foresaw him appearing it would
also foresee him disappearing, and leaving a few faint traces just as
he has left a few faint traces; if they are traces. To foresee that
Missing Link would not be to foresee Man, or anything like Man. Now
this earlier explanation must be kept in mind; because it is an exact
parallel to the true view of the Church; and the suggestion of it
having evolved naturally out of the Empire in decay.

The truth is that in one sense a man might very well have predicted
that the imperial decadence would produce something like Christianity.
That is, something a little like and gigantically different. A man
might very well have said, for instance, 'Pleasure has been pursued so
extravagantly that there will be a reaction into pessimism. Perhaps it
will take the form of asceticism; men will mutilate themselves instead
of merely hanging themselves.' Or a man might very reasonably have
said, 'If we weary of our Greek and Latin gods we shall be hankering
after some eastern mystery or other; there will be a fashion in
Persians or Hindoos.' Or a man of the world might well have been shrewd
enough to say, 'Powerful people are picking up these fads; some day
the court will adopt one of them and it may become official.' Or yet
another and gloomier prophet might be pardoned for saying, 'The world
is going down-hill; dark and barbarous superstitions will return, it
does not matter much which. They will all be formless and fugitive like
dreams of the night.'

Now it is the intense interest of the case that all these prophecies
were really fulfilled; but it was not the Church that fulfilled them.
It was the Church that escaped from them, confounded them, and rose
above them in triumph. In so far as it was probable that the mere
nature of hedonism would produce a mere reaction of asceticism it did
produce a mere reaction of asceticism. It was the movement called
Manichean and the Church was its mortal enemy. In so far as it would
have naturally appeared at that point of history, it did appear; it did
also disappear, which was equally natural. The mere pessimist reaction
did come with the Manichees and did go with the Manichees But the
Church did not come with them or go with them; and she had much more
to do with them going than with their coming. Or again, in so far as
it was probable that even the growth of scepticism would bring in a
fashion of eastern religion, it did bring it in; Mithras came from far
beyond Palestine out of the heart of Persia, bringing strange mysteries
of the blood of bulls. Certainly there was everything to show that
some such fashion would have come in any case but certainly there is
nothing in the world to show that it would not have passed away in any
case. Certainly an Oriental fad was something eminently fitted to the
fourth or fifth century; but that hardly explains it having remained to
the twentieth century, and still going strong. In short, in so far as
things of the kind might have been expected then, things like Mithraism
were experienced then; but it scarcely explains our more recent
experiences. And if we were still Mithraists merely because Mithraic
head-dresses and other Persian apparatuses might be expected to be all
the rage in the days of Domitian, it would almost seem by this time
that we must be a little dowdy.

It is the same, as will be suggested in a moment, with the idea of
official favouritism. In so far as such favouritism shown towards a
fad was something that might have been looked for during the decline
and fall of the Roman Empire, it was something that did exist in that
Empire and did decline and fall with it. It throws no sort of light
on the thing that resolutely refused to decline and fall; that grew
steadily while the other was declining and falling; and which even at
this moment is going forward with fearless energy, when an other aeon
has completed its cycle and another civilisation seems almost ready to
fall or to decline.

Now the curious fact is this; that the very heresies which the early
Church is blamed for crushing testify to the unfairness for which she
is blamed. In so far as something deserved the blame, it was precisely
the things that she is blamed for blaming. In so far as something was
merely a superstition, she herself condemned that superstition. In
so far as something was a mere reaction into barbarism, she herself
resisted it because it was a reaction into barbarism. In so far as
something was a fad of the fading empire, that died and deserved
to die, it was the Church alone that killed it. The Church is
reproached for being exactly what the heresy was repressed for being
The explanations of the evolutionary historians and higher critics
do really explain why Arianism and Gnosticism and Nestorianism were
born--and also why they died. They do not explain why the Church was
born or why she has refused to die. Above all, they do not explain why
she should have made war on the very evils she is supposed to share.

Let us take a few practical examples of the principle; the principle
that if there was anything that was really a superstition of the dying
empire, it did really die with the dying empire; and certainly was
not the same as the very thing that destroyed it. For this purpose we
will take in order two or three of the most ordinary explanations of
Christian origins among the modern critics of Christianity. Nothing
is more common, for instance, than to find such a modern critic
writing something like this: 'Christianity was above all a movement
of ascetics, a rush into the desert, a refuge in the cloister, a
renunciation of all life and happiness; and this was a part of a gloomy
and in human reaction against nature itself, a hatred of the body, a
horror of the material universe, a sort of universal suicide of the
senses and even of the self. It came from an eastern fanaticism like
that of the fakirs and was ultimately founded on an eastern pessimism,
which seems to feel existence itself as an evil.'

Now the most extraordinary thing about this is that it is all
quite true; it is true in every detail except that it happens to
be attributed entirely to the wrong person. It is not true of the
Church; but it is true of the heretics condemned by the Church. It is
as if one were to write a most detailed analysis of the mistakes and
misgovernment of the ministers of George the Third, merely with the
small inaccuracy that the whole story was told about George Washington;
or as if somebody made a list of the crimes of the Bolshevists with no
variation except that they were all attributed to the Czar. The early
Church was indeed very ascetic in connection with a totally different
philosophy; but the philosophy of a war on life and nature as such
really did exist in the world, if the critics only knew where to look
for it.

What really happened was this. When the Faith first emerged into the
world, the very first thing that happened to it was that it was caught
in a sort of swarm of mystical and metaphysical sects, mostly out of
the East; like one lonely golden bee caught in a swarm of wasps. To
the ordinary onlooker, there did not seem to be much difference, or
anything beyond a general buzz; indeed in a sense there was not much
difference so far as stinging and being stung were concerned. The
difference was that only one golden dot in all that whirring gold-dust
had the power of going forth to make hives for all humanity; to give
the world honey and wax or (as was so finely said in a context too
easily forgotten) 'the two noblest things, which are sweetness and
light.' The wasps all died that winter; and half the difficulty is
that hardly anyone knows anything about them and most people do not
know that they ever existed; so that the whole story of that first
phase of our religion is lost. Or, to vary the metaphor, when this
movement or some other movement pierced the dyke between the east and
west and brought more mystical ideas into Europe, it brought with it
a whole flood of other mystical ideas besides its own, most of them
ascetical and nearly all of them pessimistic. They very nearly flooded
and over-whelmed the purely Christian element. They came mostly from
that region that was a sort of dim borderland between the eastern
philosophies and the eastern mythologies, and which shared with the
wilder philosophers that curious crave for making fantastic patterns
of the cosmos in the shape of maps and genealogical trees. Those that
are supposed to derive from the mysterious Manes are called Manichean;
kindred cults are more generally known as Gnostic; they are mostly of a
labyrinthine complexity, but the point to insist on is the pessimism;
the fact that nearly all in one form or another regarded the creation
of the world as the work of an evil spirit. Some of them had that
Asiatic atmosphere that surrounds Buddhism; the suggestion that life is
a corruption of the purity of being. Some of them suggested a purely
spiritual order which had been betrayed by the coarse and clumsy trick
of making such toys as the sun and moon and stars. Anyhow all this dark
tide out of the metaphysical sea in the midst of Asia poured through
the dykes simultaneously with the creed of Christ; but it is the whole
point of the story that the two were not the same; that they flowed
like oil and water. That creed remained in the shape of a miracle; a
river still flowing through the sea. And the proof of the miracle was
practical once more; it was merely that while all that sea was salt and
bitter with the savour of death, of this one stream in the midst of it
a man could drink.

Now that purity was preserved by dogmatic definitions and exclusions.
It could not possibly have been preserved by anything else If the
Church had not renounced the Manicheans it might have become merely
Manichean. If it had not renounced the Gnostics it might have become
Gnostic. But by the very fact that it did renounce them it proved
that it was not either Gnostic or Manichean. At any rate it proved
that something was not either Gnostic or Manichean; and what could
it be that condemned them, if it was not the original good news of
the runners from Bethlehem and the trumpet of the Resurrection? The
early Church was ascetic, but she proved that she was not pessimistic,
simply by condemning the pessimists. The creed declared that man was
sinful, but it did not declare that life was evil, and it proved it
by damning those who did. The condemnation of the early heretics is
itself condemned as something crabbed and narrow; but it was in truth
the very proof that the Church meant to be brotherly and broad. It
proved that the primitive Catholics were specially eager to explain
that they did not think man utterly vile; that they did not think
life incurably miserable; that they did not think marriage a sin or
procreation a tragedy. They were ascetic because asceticism was the
only possible purge of the sins of the world; but in the very thunder
of their anathemas they affirmed for ever that their asceticism was
not to be anti-human or anti-natural; that they did wish to purge the
world and not destroy it. And nothing else except those anathemas could
possibly have made it clear, amid a confusion which still confuses them
with their mortal enemies. Nothing else but dogma could have resisted
the riot of imaginative invention with which the pessimists were waging
their war against nature; with their Aeons and their Demiurge, their
strange Logos and their sinister Sophia. If the Church had not insisted
on theology, it would have melted into a mad mythology of the mystics,
yet further removed from reason or even from rationalism; and, above
all yet further removed from life and from the love of life. Remember
that it would have been an inverted mythology, one contradicting
everything natural in paganism; a mythology in which Pluto would be
above Jupiter and Hades hang higher than Olympus; in which Brahma and
all that has the breath of life would be subject to Seeva, shining with
the eye of death.

That the early Church was itself full of an ecstatic enthusiasm for
renunciation and virginity makes this distinction much more striking
and not less so. It makes all the more important the place where the
dogma drew the line. A man might crawl about on all fours like a beast
because he was an ascetic. He might stand night and day on the top
of a pillar and be adored for being an ascetic, but he could not say
that the world was a mistake or the marriage state a sin without being
a heretic. What was it that thus deliberately disengaged itself from
eastern asceticism by sharp definition and fierce refusal, if it was
not something with an individuality of its own; and one that was quite
different? If the Catholics are to be confused with the Gnostics, we
can only say it was not their fault if they are. And it is rather hard
that the Catholics should be blamed by the same critics for persecuting
the heretics and also for sympathising with the heresy.

The Church was not a Manichean movement if only because it was not a
movement at all. It was not even merely an ascetical movement, because
it was not a movement at all. It would be nearer the truth to call
it the tamer of asceticism than the mere leader or loosener of it.
It was a thing having its own theory of asceticism, its own type of
asceticism, but most conspicuous at the moment as the moderator of
other theories and types. This is the only sense that can be made,
for instance, of the story of St. Augustine. As long as he was a mere
man of the world, a mere man drifting with his time, he actually
was a Manichean. It really was quite modern and fashionable to be a
Manichean. But when he became a Catholic, the people he instantly
turned on and rent in pieces were the Manicheans. The Catholic way of
putting it is that he left off being a pessimist to become an ascetic.
But as the pessimists interpreted asceticism, it ought to be said that
he left off being an ascetic to become a saint. The war upon life, the
denial of nature, were exactly the things he had already found in the
heathen world outside the Church, and had to renounce when he entered
the Church. The very fact that St Augustine remains a somewhat sterner
or sadder figure than St. Francis or St. Teresa only accentuates the
dilemma. Face to face with the gravest or even grimmest of Catholics,
we can still ask, 'Why did Catholicism make war on Manichees, if
Catholicism was Manichean?'

Take another rationalistic explanation of the rise of Christendom. It
is common enough to find another critic saying, 'Christianity did not
really rise at all; that is, it did not merely rise from below; it was
imposed from above. It is an example of the power of the executive,
especially in despotic states. The Empire was really an Empire; that
is, it was really ruled by the Emperor. One of the Emperors happened to
become a Christian. He might just as well have become a Mithraist or a
Jew or a Fire-Worshipper; it was common in the decline of the Empire
for eminent and educated people to adopt these eccentric eastern cults.
But when he adopted it, it became the official religion of the Roman
Empire; and when it became the official religion of the Roman Empire,
it became as strong, as universal and as invincible as the Roman
Empire. It has only remained in the world as a relic of that Empire;
or, as many have put it, it is but the ghost of Caesar still hovering
over Rome.' This also is a very ordinary line taken in the criticism
of orthodoxy, to say that it was only officialism that ever made it
orthodoxy. And here again we can call on the heretics to refute it.

The whole great history of the Arian heresy might have been invented
to explode this idea. It is a very interesting history often repeated
in this connection; and the upshot of it is in that in so far as
there ever was a merely official religion, it actually died because
it was merely an official religion; and what destroyed it was the
real religion. Arius advanced a version of Christianity which moved,
more or less vaguely, in the direction of what we should call
Unitarianism; though it was not the same, for it gave to Christ a
curious intermediary position between the divine and human. The point
is that it seemed to many more reasonable and less fanatical; and among
these were many of the educated class in a sort of reaction against the
first romance of conversion. Arians were a sort of moderates and a sort
of modernists. And it was felt that after the first squabbles this was
the final form of rationalised religion into which civilisation might
well settle down. It was accepted by Divus Caesar himself and became
the official orthodoxy; the generals and military princes drawn from
the new barbarian powers of the north, full of the future, supported it
strongly. But the sequel is still more important. Exactly as a modern
man might pass through Unitarianism to complete agnosticism, so the
greatest of the Arian emperors ultimately shed the last and thinnest
pretense of Christianity; he abandoned ever Arius and returned to
Apollo. He was a Caesar of the Caesars; a soldier, a scholar, a man of
large ambitions and ideals; another of the philosopher kings. It seemed
to him as if at his signal the sun rose again. The oracles began to
speak like birds beginning to sing at dawn; paganism was itself again;
the gods returned. It seemed the end of that strange interlude of an
alien superstition. And indeed it was the end of it, so far as there
was a mere interlude of mere superstition. It was the end of it, in so
far as it was the fad of an emperor or the fashion of a generation. If
there really was something that began with Constantine, then it ended
with Julian.

But there was something that did not end. There had arisen in that
hour of history, defiant above the democratic tumult of the Councils
of the Church, Athanasius against the world. We may pause upon the
point at issue; because it is relevant to the whole of this religious
history, and the modern world seems to miss the whole point of it. We
might put it this way. If there is one question which the enlightened
and liberal have the habit of deriding and holding up as a dreadful
example of barren dogma and senseless sectarian strife, it is this
Athanasian question of the Co-Eternity of the Divine Son. On the other
hand, if there is one thing that the same liberals always offer us
as a piece of pure and simple Christianity, untroubled by doctrinal
disputes, it is the single sentence, 'God is Love.' Yet the two
statements are almost identical; at least one is very nearly nonsense
without the other. The barren dogma is only the logical way of stating
the beautiful sentiment. For if there be a being without beginning,
existing before all things, was He loving when there was nothing to
be loved? If through that unthinkable eternity He is lonely, what is
the meaning of saying He is love? The only justification of such a
mystery is the mystical conception that in His own nature there was
something analogous to self-expression; something of what begets and
beholds what it has begotten. Without some such idea, it is really
illogical to complicate the ultimate essence of deity with an idea like
love. If the moderns really want a simple religion of love, they must
look for it in the Athanasian Creed. The truth is that the trumpet of
true Christianity, the challenge of the charities and simplicities
of Bethlehem or Christmas Day never rang out more arrestingly and
unmistakably than in the defiance of Athanasius to the cold compromise
of the Arians. It was emphatically he who really was fighting for a
God of Love against a God of colourless and remote cosmic control; the
God of the stoics and the agnostics. It was emphatically he who was
fighting for the Holy Child against the grey deity of the Pharisees
and the Sadducees. He was fighting for that very balance of beautiful
interdependence and intimacy, in the very Trinity of the Divine Nature,
that draws our hearts to the Trinity of the Holy Family. His dogma, if
the phrase be not misunderstood, turns even God into a Holy Family.

That this purely Christian dogma actually for a second time rebelled
against the Empire, and actually for a second time refounded the Church
in spite of the Empire, is itself a proof that there was something
positive and personal working in the world, other than whatever
official faith the Empire chose to adopt. This power utterly destroyed
the official faith that the Empire did adopt. It went on its own way
as it is going on its own way still. There are any number of other
examples in which is repeated precisely the same process we have
reviewed in the case of the Manichean and the Arian. A few centuries
afterwards, for instance, the Church had to maintain the same Trinity,
which is simply the logical side of love, against another appearance
of the isolated and simplified deity in the religion of Islam. Yet
there are some who cannot see what the Crusaders were fighting for; and
some even who talk as if Christianity had never been anything but a
form of what they call Hebraism coming in with the decay of Hellenism.
Those people must certainly be very much puzzled by the war between
the Crescent and the Cross. If Christianity had never been anything
but a simpler morality sweeping away polytheism, there is no reason
why Christendom should not have been swept into Islam. The truth is
that Islam itself was a barbaric reaction against that very humane
complexity that is really a Christian character; that idea of balance
in the deity, as of balance in the family, that makes that creed a sort
of sanity, and that sanity the soul of civilisation. And that is why
the Church is from the first a thing holding its own position and point
of view, quite apart from the accidents and anarchies of its age. That
is why it deals blows impartially right and left, at the pessimism of
the Manichean or the optimism of the Pelagian. It was not a Manichean
movement because it was not a movement at all. It was not an official
fashion because it was not a fashion at all. It was something that
could coincide with movements and fashions, could control them and
could survive them.

So might rise from their graves the great heresiarchs to confound their
comrades of to-day. There is nothing that the critics now affirm that
we cannot call on these great witnesses to deny. The modern critic
will say lightly enough that Christianity was but a reaction into
asceticism and anti-natural spirituality, a dance of fakirs furious
against life and love. But Manes the great mystic will answer them
from his secret throne and cry, 'These Christians have no right to be
called spiritual; these Christians have no title to be called ascetics,
they who compromised with the curse of life and all the filth of the
family. Through them the earth is still foul with fruit and harvest and
polluted with population Theirs was no movement against nature, or my
children would have carried it to triumph; but these fools renewed the
world when I would have ended it with a gesture.' And another critic
will write that the Church was but the shadow of the Empire, the fad
of a chance Emperor, and that it remains in Europe only as the ghost
of the power of Rome. And Arius the deacon will answer out of the
darkness of oblivious 'No, indeed, or the world would have followed
my more reasonable religion. For mine went down before demagogues and
men defying Caesar; and around my champion was the purple cloak and
mine was the glory of the eagles. It was not for lack of these things
that I failed. And yet a third modern will maintain that the creed
spread only as a sort of panic of hell-fire; men everywhere attempting
impossible things in fleeing from incredible vengeance; a nightmare of
imaginary remorse; and such an explanation will satisfy many who see
something dreadful in the doctrine of orthodoxy. And then there will
go up against it the terrible voice of Tertullian, saying, 'And why
then was I cast out; and why did soft hearts and heads decide against
me when I proclaimed the perdition of all sinners; and what was this
power that thwarted me when I threatened all backsliders with hell?
For none ever went up that hard road so far as I; and mine was the
Credo Quia Impossible.' Then there is the fourth suggestion that there
was something of the Semitic secret society in the whole matter; that
it was a new invasion of the nomad spirit shaking a kindlier and more
comfortable paganism, its cities and its household gods; whereby the
jealous monotheistic races could after all establish their jealous
God. And Mahomet shall answer out of the whirlwind, the red whirlwind
of the desert, 'Who ever served the jealousy of God as I did or left
him more lonely in the sky? Who ever paid more honour to Moses and
Abraham or won more victories over idols and the images of paganism?
And what was this thing that thrust me back with the energy of a thing
alive; whose fanaticism could drive me from Sicily and tear up my deep
roots out of the rock of Spain? What faith was theirs who thronged in
thousands of every class a country crying out that my ruin was the will
of God; and what hurled great Godfrey as from a catapult over the wall
of Jerusalem, and what brought great Sobieski like a thunderbolt to the
gates of Vienna? I think there was more than you fancy in the religion
that has so matched itself with mine.'

Those who would suggest that the faith was a fanaticism are doomed
to an eternal perplexity. In their account it is bound to appear
as fanatical for nothing, and fanatical against everything. It is
ascetical and at war with ascetics, Roman and in revolt against
Rome, monotheistic and fighting furiously against monotheism; harsh
in its condemnation of harshness; a riddle not to be explained even
as unreason. And what sort of unreason is it that seems reasonable
to millions of educated Europeans through all the revolutions of
some sixteen hundred years? People are not amused with a puzzle or a
paradox or a mere muddle in the mind for all that time. I know of no
explanation except that such a thing is not unreason but reason; that
if it is fanatical it is fanatical for reason and fanatical against all
the unreasonable things. That is the only explanation I can find of a
thing from the first so detached and so confident, condemning things
that looked so like itself, refusing help from powers that seemed so
essential to its existence, sharing on its human side all the passions
of the age, yet always at the supreme moment suddenly rising superior
to them, never saying exactly what it was expected to say and never
needing to unsay what it had said; I can find no explanation except
that, like Pallas from the brain of Jove, it had indeed come forth out
of the mind of God, mature and mighty and armed for judgement and for
war.

V

THE ESCAPE FROM PAGANISM

The modern missionary, with his palm-leaf hat and his umbrella, has
become rather a figure of fun. He is chaffed among men of the world
for the ease with which he can be eaten by cannibals and the narrow
bigotry which makes him regard the cannibal culture as lower than his
own. Perhaps the best part of the joke is that the men of the world do
not see that the joke is against themselves. It is rather ridiculous
to ask a man just about to be boiled in a pot and eaten, at a purely
religious feast, why he does not regard all religions as equally
friendly and fraternal. But there is a more subtle criticism uttered
against the more old-fashioned missionary; to the effect that he
generalises too broadly about the heathen and pays too little attention
to the difference between Mahomet and Mumbo-Jumbo. There was probably
truth in this complaint, especially in the past; but it is my main
contention here that the exaggeration is all the other way at present.
It is the temptation of the professors to treat mythologies too much as
theologies; as things thoroughly thought out are seriously held. It is
the temptation of the intellectuals to take much too seriously the fine
shades of various schools in the rather irresponsible metaphysics of
Asia. Above all it is their temptation to miss the real truth implied
in the idea of Aquinas contra Gentiles or Athanasius contra mundum.

If the missionary says, in fact, that he is exceptional in being
a Christian, and that the rest of the races and religions can be
collectively classified as heathen, he is perfectly right. He may say
it in quite the wrong spirit, in which case he is spiritually wrong.
But in the cold light of philosophy and history, he is intellectually
right. He may not be right minded, but he is right. He may not
even have a right to be right, but he is right. The outer world to
which he brings his creed really is some thing subject to certain
generalisations covering all its varieties, and is not merely a variety
of similar creeds. Perhaps it is in any case too much of a temptation
to pride or hypocrisy to call it heathenry. Perhaps it could be better
simply to call it humanity. But there are certain broad characteristics
of what we call humanity while it remains in what we call heathenry.
They are not necessarily bad characteristics; some of them are worthy
of the respect of Christendom; some of them have been absorbed and
transfigured in the substance of Christendom. But they existed before
Christendom and they still exist outside Christendom, as certainly as
the sea existed before a boat and all round a boat; and they have as
strong and as universal and as unmistakable a savour as the sea.

For instance, all real scholars who have studied the Greek and Roman
culture say one thing about it. They agree that in the ancient world
religion was one thing and philosophy quite another, there was very
little effort to rationalise and at the same time to realise a real
belief in the gods. There was very little pretense of any such real
belief among the philosophers. But neither had the passion or perhaps
the power to persecute the others save in particular and peculiar
cases; and neither the philosopher in his school nor the priest in
his temple seems ever to have seriously contemplated his own concept
as covering the world. A priest sacrificing to Artemis in Calydon did
not seem to think that people would some day sacrifice to her instead
of to Isis beyond the sea; a sage following the vegetarian rule of
the Neo-Pythagoreans did not seem to think it would universally
prevail and exclude the methods of Epictetus or Epicurus. We may call
this liberality if we like; I am not dealing with an argument but
describing an atmosphere. All this, I say, is admitted by all scholars;
but what neither the learned nor the unlearned have fully realised,
perhaps, is that this description is really an exact description of
all non-Christian civilisation today; and especially of the great
civilisations of the East. Eastern paganism really is much more all
of a piece, just as ancient paganism was much more all of a piece,
than the modern critics admit. It is a many-coloured Persian Carpet
as the other was a varied and tessellated Roman pavement; but the one
real crack right across that pavement came from the earthquake of the
Crucifixion.

The modern European seeking his religion in Asia is reading his
religion into Asia. Religion there is something different; it is both
more and less. He is like a man mapping out the sea as land; marking
waves as mountains; not understanding the nature of its peculiar
permanence. It is perfectly true that Asia has its own dignity and
poetry and high civilisation. But it is not in the least true that
Asia has its own definite dominions of moral government, where all
loyalty is conceived in terms of morality; as when we say that Ireland
is Catholic or that New England was Puritan. The map is not marked
out in religions, in our sense of churches. The state of mind is far
more subtle, more relative, more secretive, more varied and changing,
like the colours of the snake. The Moslem is the nearest approach to a
militant Christian; and that is precisely because he is a much nearer
approach to an envoy from western civilisation. The Moslem in the heart
of Asia almost stands for the soul of Europe. And as he stands between
them and Europe in the matter of space so he stands between them and
Christianity in the matter of time. In that sense the Moslems in Asia
are merely like the Nestorians in Asia. Islam, historically speaking,
is the greatest of the Eastern heresies. It owed something to the
quite isolated and unique individuality of Israel; but it owed more
to Byzantium and the theological enthusiasm of Christendom. It owed
something even to the Crusades. It owed nothing whatever to Asia. It
owed nothing to the atmosphere of the ancient and traditional world of
Asia, with its immemorial etiquette and its bottomless or bewildering
philosophies. All that ancient and actual Asia felt the entrance of
Islam as something foreign and western and warlike, piercing it like a
spear.

Even where we might trace in dotted lines the domains of Asiatic
religions, we should probably be reading into them something dogmatic
and ethical belonging to our own religion. It is as if a European
ignorant of the American atmosphere were to suppose that each 'state'
was a separate sovereign state as patriotic as France or Poland; or
that when a Yankee referred fondly to his 'home town' he meant he
had no other nation, like a citizen of ancient Athens or Rome. As he
would be reading a particular sort of loyalty into America, so we are
reading a particular sort of loyalty into Asia. There are loyalties of
other kinds; but not what men in the West mean by being a believer, by
trying to be a Christian, by being a good Protestant or a practising
Catholic. In the intellectual world it means something far more vague
and varied by doubts and speculations. In the moral world it means
something far more loose and drifting. A professor of Persian at
one of our great universities, so passionate a partisan of the East
as practically to profess a contempt for the West, said to a friend
of mine: 'You will never understand oriental religions, because you
always conceive religion as connected with ethics. This kind has really
nothing to do with ethics.' We have most of us known some Masters of
the Higher Wisdom, some Pilgrims upon the Path to Power, some eastern
esoteric saints and seers, who had really nothing to do with ethics.
Something different, something detached and irresponsible, tinges the
moral atmosphere of Asia and touches even that of Islam. It was very
realistically caught in the atmosphere of Hassan; and a very horrible
atmosphere too. It is even more vivid in such glimpses as we get of
the genuine and ancient cults of Asia. Deeper than the depths of
metaphysics, far down in the abysses of mystical meditations under all
that solemn universe of spiritual things, is a secret, an intangible
and a terrible levity. It does not really very much matter what one
does. Either because they do not believe in a devil, or because they
do believe in a destiny, or because experience here is everything and
eternal life something totally different, but for some reason they are
totally different. I have read somewhere that there were three great
friends famous in medieval Persia for their unity of mind. One became
the responsible and respected Vizier of the Great King; the second was
the poet Omar, pessimist and epicurean, drinking wine in mockery of
Mahomet; the third was the Old Man of the Mountain who maddened his
people with hashish that they might murder other people with daggers.
It does not really much matter what one does.

The Sultan in Hassan would have understood all those three men; indeed
he was all those three men. But this sort of universalist cannot have
what we call a character; it is what we call a chaos. He cannot choose;
he cannot fight; he cannot repent; he cannot hope. He is not in the
same sense creating something; for creation means rejection. He is not,
in our religious phrase, making his soul. For our doctrine of salvation
does really mean a labour like that of a man trying to make a statue
beautiful; a victory with wings. For that there must be a final choice,
for a man cannot make statues without rejecting stone. And there really
is this ultimate unmorality behind the metaphysics of Asia. And the
reason is that there has been nothing through all those unthinkable
ages to bring the human mind sharply to the point; to tell it that the
time has come to choose. The mind has lived too much in eternity. The
soul has been too immortal, in the special sense that it ignores the
idea of mortal sin. It has had too much of eternity, in the sense that
it has not had enough of the hour of death and the day of judgement. It
is not crucial enough; in the literal sense that it has not had enough
of the cross. That is what we mean when we say that Asia is very old.
But strictly speaking Europe is quite as old as Asia; indeed in a sense
any place is as old as any other place. What we mean is that Europe has
not merely gone on growing older. It has been born again.

Asia is all humanity; as it has worked out its human doom. Asia, in
its vast territory, in its varied populations, in its heights of past
achievement and its depths of dark speculation, is itself a world; and
represents something of what we mean when we speak of the world. It
is a cosmos rather than a continent. It is the world as man has made
it; and contains many of the most wonderful things that man has made.
Therefore Asia stands as the one representative of paganism and the
one rival to Christendom. But everywhere else where we get glimpses of
that mortal destiny, they suggest stages in the same story. Where Asia
trails away into the southern archipelagoes of the savages, or where
a darkness full of nameless shapes dwells in the heart of Africa, or
where the last survivors of lost races linger in the cold volcano of
prehistoric America, it is all the same story; sometimes perhaps later
chapters of the same story. It is men entangled in the forest of their
own mythology; it is men drowned in the sea of their own metaphysics.
Polytheists have grown weary of the wildest of fictions. Monotheists
have grown weary of the most wonderful of truths. Diabolists here and
there have such a hatred of heaven and earth that they have tried to
take refuge in hell. It is the Fall of Man; and it is exactly that fall
that was being felt by our own fathers at the first moment of the Roman
decline. We also were going down that side road; down that easy slope;
following the magnificent procession of the high civilisations of the
world.

If the Church had not entered the world then, it seems probable that
Europe would be now very much what Asia is now. Something may be
allowed for a real difference of race and environment, visible in
the ancient as in the modern world. But after all we talk about the
changeless East very largely because it has not suffered the great
change. Paganism in its last phase showed considerable signs of be
coming equally changeless. This would not mean that new schools or
sects of philosophy would not arise; as new schools did arise in
Antiquity and do arise in Asia. It does not mean that there would be no
real mystics or visionaries; as there were mystics in Antiquity and are
mystics in Asia. It does not mean that there would be no social codes,
as there were codes in Antiquity and are codes in Asia. It does not
mean that there could not be good men or happy lives, for God has given
all men a conscience and conscience can give all men a kind of peace.
But it does mean that the tone and proportion of all these things, and
especially the proportion of good and evil things, would be in the
unchanged West what they are in the changeless East. And nobody who
looks at that changeless East honestly, and with a real sympathy, can
believe that there is anything there remotely resembling the challenge
and revolution of the Faith.

In short, if classic paganism had lingered until now, a number of
things might well have lingered with it; and they would look very
like what we call the religions of the East. There would still be
Pythagoreans teaching reincarnation, as there are still Hindus teaching
reincarnation. There would still be Stoics making a religion out of
reason and virtue, as there are still Confucians making a religion out
of reason and virtue. There would still be Neo-Platonists studying
transcendental truths, the meaning of which was mysterious to other
people and disputed even amongst themselves; as the Buddhists still
study a transcendentalism mysterious to others and disputed among
themselves. There would still be intelligent Apollonians apparently
worshipping the sun-god but explaining that they were worshipping
the divine principle; just as there are still intelligent Parsees
apparently worshipping the sun but explaining that they are worshipping
the deity. There would still be wild Dionysians dancing on the mountain
as there are still wild Dervishes dancing in the desert. There would
still be crowds of people attending the popular feasts of the gods, in
pagan Europe as in pagan Asia. There would still be crowds of gods,
local and other, for them to worship. And there would still be a great
many more people who worshipped them than people who believed in them.
Finally there would still be a very large number of people who did
worship gods and did believe in gods; and who believed in gods and
worshipped gods simply because they were demons. There would still be
Levantines secretly sacrificing to Moloch as there are still Thugs
secretly sacrificing to Kalee. There would still be a great deal of
magic; and a great deal of it would be black magic. There would still
be a considerable admiration of Seneca and a considerable imitation
of Nero; just as the exalted epigrams of Confucius could coexist with
the tortures of China. And over all that tangled forest of traditions
growing wild or withering would brood the broad silence of a singular
and even nameless mood; but the nearest name of it is nothing. All
these things, good and bad, would have an indescribable air of being
too old to die.

None of these things occupying Europe in the absence of Christendom
would bear the least likeness to Christendom. Since the Pythagorean
Metempsychosis would still be there, we might call it the Pythagorean
religion as we talk about the Buddhist religion. As the noble maxims of
Socrates would still be there, we might call it the Socratic religion
as we talk about the Confucian religion. As the popular holiday was
still marked by a mythological hymn to Adonis, we might call it the
religion of Adonis as we talk about the religion of Juggernaut. As
literature would still be based on the Greek mythology, we might call
that mythology a religion, as we call the Hindu mythology a religion.
We might say that there were so many thousands or millions of people
belonging to that religion, in the sense of frequenting such temples
or merely living in a land full of such temples. But if we called the
last tradition of Pythagoras or the lingering legend of Adonis by the
name of a religion, then we must find some other name for the Church of
Christ.

If anybody says that philosophic maxims presented through many ages, or
mythological temples frequented by many people, are things of the same
class and category as the Church, it is enough to answer quite simply
that they are not. Nobody thinks they are the same when he sees them in
the old civilisation of Greece and Rome; nobody would think they were
the same if that civilisation had lasted two thousand years longer and
existed at the present day; nobody can in reason think they are the
same in the parallel pagan civilisation in the East, as it is at the
present day. None of these philosophies or mythologies are anything
like a Church; certainly nothing like a Church Militant. And, as I
have shown elsewhere, even if this rule were not already proved, the
exception would prove the rule. The rule is that pre-Christian or pagan
history does not produce a Church Militant; and the exception, or what
some would call the exception, is that Islam is at least militant if it
is not Church. And that is precisely because Islam is the one religious
rival that is not pre-Christian and therefore not in that sense pagan.
Islam was a product of Christianity; even if it was a by-product;
even if it was a bad product. It was a heresy or parody emulating
and therefore imitating the Church. It is no more surprising that
Mahomedanism had something of her fighting spirit than that Quakerism
had something of her peaceful spirit. After Christianity there are any
number of such emulations or extensions. Before it there are none.

The Church Militant is thus unique because it is an army marching to
effect a universal deliverance. The bondage from which the world is
thus to be delivered is something that is very well symbolised by the
state of Asia as by the state of pagan Europe. I do not mean merely
their moral or immoral state. The missionary, as a matter of fact,
has much more to say for himself than the enlightened imagine even
when he says that the heathen are idolatrous and immoral. A touch or
two of realistic experience about Eastern religion, even about Moslem
religion, will reveal some startling insensibilities in ethics; such as
the practical indifference to the line between passion and perversion.
It is not prejudice but practical experience which says that Asia is
full of demons as well as gods. But the evil I mean is in the mind.
And it is in the mind wherever the mind has worked for a long time
alone. It is what happens when all dreaming and thinking have come
to an end in an emptiness that is at once negation and necessity. It
sounds like an anarchy, but it is also a slavery. It is what has been
called already the wheel of Asia; all those recurrent arguments about
cause and effect or things beginning and ending in the mind, which make
it impossible for the soul really to strike out and go anywhere or
do anything. And the point is that it is not necessarily peculiar to
Asiatics; it would have been true in the end of Europeans--if something
had not happened. If the Church Militant had not been a thing marching,
all men would have been marking time. If the Church Militant had not
endured a discipline, all men would have endured a slavery.

What that universal yet fighting faith brought into the world was hope.
Perhaps the one thing common to mythology and philosophy was that both
were really sad; in the sense that they had not this hope even if they
had touches of faith or charity. We may call Buddhism a faith; though
to us it seems more like a doubt. We may call the Lord of Compassion a
Lord of Charity, though it seems to us a very pessimist sort of pity.
But those who insist most on the antiquity and size of such cults
must agree that in all their ages they have not covered all their
areas with that sort of practical and pugnacious hope. In Christendom
hope has never been absent; rather it has been errant, extravagant,
excessively fixed upon fugitive chances. Its perpetual revolution and
reconstruction has at least been an evidence of people being in better
spirits. Europe did very truly renew its youth like the eagles; just
as the eagles of Rome rose again over the legions of Napoleon, or we
have seen soaring but yesterday the silver eagle of Poland. But in
the Polish case ever revolution always went with religion. Napoleon
himself sought a reconciliation with religion. Religion could never
be finally separated even from the most hostile of the hopes; simply
because it was the very source of the hopefulness. And the cause of
this is to be found simply in the religion itself. Those who quarrel
about it seldom even consider it in itself. There is neither space nor
place for such a full consideration here; but a word may be said to
explain a reconciliation that always recurs and still seems to require
explanation.

There will be no end to the weary debates about liberalising theology,
until people face the fact that the only liberal part of it is really
the dogmatic part. If dogma is incredible, it is because it is
incredibly liberal. If it is irrational, it can only be in giving us
more assurance of freedom than is justified by reason. The obvious
example is that essential form of freedom which we call free-will.
It is absurd to say that a man shows his liberality in denying his
liberty. But it is tenable that he has to affirm a transcendental
doctrine in order to affirm his liberty. There is a sense in which we
might reasonably say that if man has a primary power of choice, he has
in that fact a super-natural power of creation, as if he could raise
the dead or give birth to the unbegotten. Possibly in that case a man
must be a miracle; and certainly in that case he must be a miracle in
order to be a man; and most certainly in order to be a free man. But
it is absurd to forbid him to be a free man and do it in the name of a
more free religion.

But it is true in twenty other matters. Anybody who believes at all in
God must believe in the absolute supremacy of God. But in so far as
that supremacy does allow of any degrees that can be called liberal or
illiberal, it is self-evident that the illiberal power is the deity of
the rationalists and the liberal power is the deity of the dogmatists.
Exactly in proportion as you turn monotheism into monism you turn it
into despotism. It is precisely the unknown God of the scientist, with
his impenetrable purpose and his inevitable and unalterable law, that
reminds us of a Prussian autocrat making rigid plans in a remote tent
and moving mankind like machinery. It is precisely the God of miracles
and of answered prayers who reminds us of a liberal and popular prince,
receiving petitions, listening to parliaments and considering the
cases of a whole people. I am not now arguing the rationality of this
conception in other respects; as a matter of fact it is not, as some
suppose, irrational; for there is nothing irrational in the wisest and
most well-informed king acting differently according to the action of
those he wishes to save. But I am here only noting the general nature
of liberality, or of free or enlarged atmosphere of action. And in
this respect it is certain that the king can only be what we call
magnanimous if he is what some call capricious. It is the Catholic, who
has the feeling that his prayers do make a difference, when offered
for the living and the dead, who also has the feeling of living like a
free citizen in something almost like a constitutional commonwealth.
It is the monist who lives under a single iron law who must have the
feeling of living like a slave under a sultan. Indeed I believe that
the original use of the word suffragium, which we now use in politics
for a vote, was that employed in theology about a prayer. The dead in
Purgatory were said to have the suffrages of the living. And in this
sense, of a sort of right of petition to the supreme ruler, we may
truly say that the whole of the Communion of Saints, as well as the
whole of the Church Militant, is founded on universal suffrage.

But above all, it is true of the most tremendous issue; of that tragedy
which has created the divine comedy of our creed. Nothing short of the
extreme and strong and startling doctrine of the divinity of Christ
will give that particular effect that can truly stir the popular sense
like a trumpet; the idea of the king himself serving in the ranks like
a common soldier. By making that figure merely human we make that story
much less human. We take away the point of the story which actually
pierces humanity; the point of the story which was quite literally the
point of a spear. It does not especially humanise the universe to say
that good and wise men can die for their opinions; any more than it
would be any sort of uproariously popular news in an army that good
soldiers may easily get killed. It is no news that King Leonidas is
dead any more than that Queen Anne is dead; and men did not wait for
Christianity to be men, in the full sense of being heroes. But if we
are describing, for the moment, the atmosphere of what is generous and
popular and even picturesque, any knowledge of human nature will tell
us that no sufferings of the sons of men, or even of the servants of
God, strike the same note as the notion of the master suffering instead
of his servants. And this is given by the theological and emphatically
not by the scientific deity. No mysterious monarch, hidden in his
starry pavilion at the base of the cosmic campaign, is in the least
like that celestial chivalry of the Captain who carries his five wounds
in the front of battle.

What the denouncer of dogma really means is not that dogma is bad; but
rather that dogma is too good to be true. That is, he means that dogma
is too liberal to be likely. Dogma gives man too much freedom when it
permits him to fall. Dogma gives even God too much freedom when it
permits him to die. That is what the intelligent sceptics ought to say;
and it is not in the least my intention to deny that there is something
to be said for it. They mean that the universe is itself a universal
prison; that existence itself is a limitation and a control; and it
is not for nothing that they call causation a chain. In a word, they
mean quite simply that they cannot believe these things; not in the
least that they are unworthy of belief. We say not lightly but very
literally, that the truth has made us free. They say that it makes us
so free that it cannot be the truth. To them it is like believing in
fairyland to believe in such freedom as we enjoy. It is like believing
in men with wings to entertain the fancy of men with wills. It is like
accepting a fable about a squirrel in conversation with a mountain to
believe in a man who is free to ask or a God who is free to answer.
This is a manly and a rational negation for which I for one shall
always show respect. But I decline to show any respect for those who
first of all clip the wings and cage the squirrel, rivet the chains and
refuse the freedom, close all the doors of the cosmic prison on us with
a clang of eternal iron, tell us that our emancipation is a dream and
our dungeon a necessity; and then calmly turn round and tell us they
have a freer thought and a more liberal theology.

The moral of all this is an old one; that religion is revelation. In
other words it is a vision, and a vision received by faith; but it is a
vision of reality. The faith consists in a conviction of its reality.
That, for example, is the difference between a vision and a day-dream.
And that is the difference between religion and mythology. That is the
difference between faith and all that fancy-work, quite human and more
or less healthy, which we considered under the head of mythology. There
is something in the reasonable use of the very word vision that implies
two things about it; first that it comes very rarely, possibly that it
comes only once; and secondly that it probably comes once and for all.
A day-dream may come every day. A day-dream may be different every day.
It is something more than the difference between telling ghost-stories
and meeting a ghost.

But if it is not a mythology neither is it a philosophy. It is not a
philosophy because, being a vision, it is not a pattern but a picture.
It is not one of those simplifications which resolve everything into an
abstract explanation; as that everything is recurrent; or everything is
relative; or everything is inevitable; or everything is illusive. It
is not a process but a story. It has proportions, of the sort seen in
a picture or a story; it has not the regular repetitions of a pattern
or a process; but it replaces them by being convincing as a picture or
a story is convincing. In other words, it is exactly, as the phrase
goes, like life. For indeed it is life. An example of what is meant
here might well be found in the treatment of the problem of evil. It is
easy enough to make a plan of life of which the background is black, as
the pessimists do; and then admit a speck or two of star-dust more or
less accidental, or at least in the literal sense insignificant. And it
is easy enough to make another plan on white paper, as the Christian
Scientists do, and explain or explain away somehow such dots or smudges
as may be difficult to deny. Lastly it is easiest of all perhaps, to
say as the dualists do, that life is like a chess-board in which the
two are equal, and can as truly be said to consist of white squares
on a black board or of black squares on a white board. But every man
feels in his heart that none of these three paper plans is like life;
that none of these worlds is one in which he can live. Something tells
him that the ultimate idea of a world is not bad or even neutral;
staring at the sky or the grass or the truths of mathematics or even a
new-laid egg, he has a vague feeling like the shadow of that saying of
the great Christian philosopher, St. Thomas Aquinas, 'Every existence,
as such, is good.' On the other hand, something else tells him that it
is unmanly and debased and even diseased to minimise evil to a dot or
even a blot. He realises that optimism is morbid. It is if possible
even more morbid than pessimism. These vague but healthy feelings, if
he followed them out, would result in the idea that evil is in some
way an exception but an enormous exception; and ultimately that evil
is an invasion or yet more truly a rebellion. He does not think that
everything is right or that every thing is wrong, or that everything is
equally right and wrong. But he does think that right has a right to
be right and therefore a right to be there, and wrong has no right to
be wrong and therefore no right to be there. It is the prince of the
world; but it is also a usurper. So he will apprehend vaguely what the
vision will give to him vividly; no less than all that strange story
of treason in heaven and the great desertion by which evil damaged
and tried to destroy a cosmos that it could not create. It is a very
strange story and its proportions and its lines and colours are as
arbitrary and absolute as the artistic composition of a picture. It is
a vision which we do in fact symbolise in pictures by titanic limbs and
passionate tints of plumage; all that abysmal vision of falling stars
and the peacock panoplies of the night. But that strange story has one
small advantage over the diagrams. It is like life.

Another example might be found, not in the problem of evil, but in what
is called the problem of progress. One of the ablest agnostics of the
age once asked me whether I thought mankind grew better or grew worse
or remained the same. He was confident that the alternative covered all
possibilities. He did not see that it only covered patterns and not
pictures; processes and not stories. I asked him whether he thought
that Mr. Smith of Golder's Green got better or worse or remained
exactly the same between the age of thirty and forty. It then seemed
to dawn on him that it would rather depend on Mr. Smith; and how he
chose to go on. It had never occurred to him that it might depend on
how mankind chose to go on; and that its course was not a straight line
or an upward or downward curve, but a track like that of a man across
a valley, going where he liked and stopping where he chose, going into
a church or falling down in a ditch. The life of man is a story; an
adventure story; and in our vision the same is true even of the story
of God.

The Catholic faith is the reconciliation because it is the realisation
both of mythology and philosophy. It is a story and in that sense one
of a hundred stories; only it is a true story. It is a philosophy and
in that sense one of a hundred philosophies; only it is a philosophy
that is like life. But above all, it is a reconciliation because
it is something that can only be called the philosophy of stories.
That normal narrative instinct which produced all the fairy tales is
something that is neglected by all the philosophies--except one. The
Faith is the justification of that popular instinct; the finding of a
philosophy for it or the analysis of the philosophy in it. Exactly as a
man in an adventure story has to pass various tests to save his life,
so the man in this philosophy has to pass several tests and save his
soul. In both there is an idea of free will operating under conditions
of design; in other words, there is an aim and it is the business of a
man to aim at it; we therefore watch to see whether he will hit it. Now
this deep and democratic and dramatic instinct is derided and dismissed
in all the other philosophies. For all the other philosophies avowedly
end where they begin; and it is the definition of a story that it ends
differently; that it begins in one place and ends in another. From
Buddha and his wheel to Akhen Aten and his disc, from Pythagoras with
his abstraction of number to Confucius with his religion of routine,
there is not one of them that does not in some way sin against the
soul of a story. There is none of them that really grasps this human
notion of the tale, the test, the adventure; the ordeal of the free
man. Each of them starves the story-telling instinct, so to speak, and
does something to spoil human life considered as a romance; either by
fatalism (pessimist or optimist) and that destiny that is the death of
adventure; or by indifference and that detachment that is the death
of drama; or by a fundamental scepticism that dissolves the actors
into atoms; or by a materialistic limitation blocking the vista of
moral consequences; or a mechanical recurrence making even moral tests
monotonous; or a bottomless relativity making even practical tests
insecure. There is such a thing as a human story; and there is such a
thing as the divine story which is also a human story; but there is no
such thing as a Hegelian story or a Monist story or a relativist story
or a determinist story; for every story, yes, even a penny dreadful or
a cheap novelette, has something in it that belongs to our universe and
not theirs. Every short story does truly begin with creation and end
with a last judgement.

And that is the reason why the myths and the philosophers were at war
until Christ came. That is why the Athenian democracy killed Socrates
out of respect for the gods; and why every strolling sophist gave
himself the airs of a Socrates whenever he could talk in a superior
fashion of the gods; and why the heretic Pharaoh wrecked his huge idols
and temples for an abstraction and why the priests could return in
triumph and trample his dynasty under foot; and why Buddhism had to
divide itself from Brahminism, and why in every age and country outside
Christendom there has been a feud for ever between the philosopher and
the priest. It is easy enough to say that the philosopher is generally
the more rational; it is easier still to forget that the priest is
always the more popular. For the priest told the people stories; and
the philosopher did not understand the philosophy of stories. It came
into the world with the story of Christ.

And this is why it had to be a revelation or vision given from above.
Any one who will think of the theory of stories or pictures will easily
see the point. The true story of the world must be told by somebody to
somebody else. By the very nature of a story it cannot be left to occur
to anybody. A story has proportions, variations, surprises, particular
dispositions, which cannot be worked out by rule in the abstract, like
a sum. We could not deduce whether or no Achilles would give back the
body of Hector from a Pythagorean theory of number or recurrence; and
we could not infer for ourselves in what way the world would get back
the body of Christ, merely from being told that all things go round
and round upon the wheel of Buddha. A man might perhaps work out a
proposition of Euclid without having heard of Euclid; but he would
not work out the precise legend of Eurydice without having heard of
Eurydice. At any rate he would not be certain how the story would end
and whether Orpheus was ultimately defeated. Still less could he guess
the end of our story; or the legend of our Orpheus rising, not defeated
from, the dead.

To sum up; the sanity of the world was restored and the soul of man
offered salvation by something which did indeed satisfy the two warring
tendencies of the past; which had never been satisfied in full and
most certainly never satisfied together. It met the mythological
search for romance by being a story and the philosophical search for
truth by being a true story. That is why the ideal figure had to be a
historical character, as nobody had ever felt Adonis or Pan to be a
historical character. But that is also why the historical character
had to be the ideal figure; and even fulfil many of the functions
given to these other ideal figures; why he was at once the sacrifice
and the feast, why he could be shown under the emblems of the growing
vine or the rising sun. The more deeply we think of the matter the more
we shall conclude that, if there be indeed a God, his creation could
hardly have reached any other culmination than this granting of a real
romance to the world. Otherwise the two sides of the human mind could
never have touched at all; and the brain of man would have remained
cloven and double; one lobe of it dreaming impossible dreams and the
other repeating invariable calculations. The picture-makers would have
remained forever painting the portrait of nobody. The sages would have
remained for ever adding up numerals that came to nothing. It was that
abyss that nothing but an incarnation could cover; a divine embodiment
of our dreams; and he stands above that chasm whose name is more than
priest and older even than Christendom; Pontifex Maximus, the mightiest
maker of a bridge.

But even with that we return to the more specially Christian symbol
in the same tradition; the perfect pattern of the keys. This is a
historical and not a theological outline, and it is not my duty here to
defend in detail that theology, but merely to point out that it could
not even be justified in design without being justified in detail--like
a key. Beyond the broad suggestion of this chapter I attempt no
apologetic about why the creed should be accepted. But in answer to
the historical query of why it was accepted and is accepted, I answer
for millions of others in my reply; because it fits the lock, because
it is like life. It is one among many stories; only it happens to be a
true story. It is one among many philosophies; only it happens to be
the truth. We accept it; and the ground is solid under our feet and the
road is open before us. It does not imprison us in a dream of destiny
or a consciousness of the universal delusion. It opens to us not
only incredible heavens but what seems to some an equally incredible
earth, and makes it credible. This is the sort of truth that is hard
to explain because it is a fact; but it is a fact to which we can call
witnesses. We are Christians and Catholics not because we worship a
key, but because we have passed a door; and felt the wind that is the
trumpet of liberty blow over the land of the living.

VI

THE FIVE DEATHS OF THE FAITH

It is not the purpose of this book to trace the subsequent history
of Christianity, especially the later history of Christianity; which
involves controversies of which I hope to write more fully elsewhere.
It is devoted only to the suggestion that Christianity, appearing amid
heathen humanity, had all the character of a unique thing and even of
a supernatural thing. It was not like any of the other things; and the
more we study it the less it looks like any of them. But there is a
certain rather peculiar character which marked it henceforward even
down to the present moment, with a note on which this book may well
conclude.

I have said that Asia and the ancient world had an air of being too old
to die. Christendom has had the very opposite fate. Christendom has had
a series of revolutions and in each one of them Christianity has died.
Christianity has died many times and risen again; for it had a God who
knew the way out of the grave. But the first extraordinary fact which
marks this history is this: that Europe has been turned upside down
over and over again; and that at the end of each of these revolutions
the same religion has again been found on top. The Faith is always
converting the age, not as an old religion but as a new religion. This
truth is hidden from many by a convention that is too little noticed.
Curiously enough, it is a convention of the sort which those who ignore
it claim especially to detect and denounce. They are always telling
us that priests and ceremonies are not religion and that religious
organisation can be a hollow sham, but they hardly realise how true it
is. It is so true that three or four times at least in the history of
Christendom the whole soul seemed to have gone out of Christianity;
and almost every man in his heart expected its end. This fact is only
masked in medieval and other times by that very official religion
which such critics pride themselves on seeing through. Christianity
remained the official religion of a Renaissance prince or the official
religion of an eighteenth-century bishop, just as an ancient mythology
remained the official religion of Julius Caesar or the Arian creed long
remained the official religion of Julian the Apostate. But there was
a difference between the cases of Julius and of Julian; because the
Church had begun its strange career. There was no reason why men like
Julius should not worship gods like Jupiter for ever in public and
laugh at them for ever in private. But when Julian treated Christianity
as dead, he found it had come to life again. He also found,
incidentally, that there was not the faintest sign of Jupiter ever
coming to life again. This case of Julian and the episode of Arianism
is but the first of a series of examples that can only be roughly
indicated here. Arianism, as has been said, had every human appearance
of being the natural way in which that particular superstition of
Constantine might be expected to peter out. All the ordinary stages
had been passed through; the creed had become a respectable thing, had
become a ritual thing, had then been modified into a rational thing;
and the rationalists were ready to dissipate the last remains of it,
just as they do to-day. When Christianity rose again suddenly and threw
them, it was almost as unexpected as Christ rising from the dead. But
there are many other examples of the same thing, even about the same
time. The rush of missionaries from Ireland, For instance, has all
the air of an unexpected onslaught of young men on an old world, and
even on a Church that showed signs of growing old. Some of them were
martyred on the coast of Cornwall; and the chief authority on Cornish
antiquities told me that he did not believe for a moment that they were
martyred by heathens but (as he expressed it with some humour) 'by
rather slack Christians.'

Now if we were to dip below the surface of history, as it is not in the
scope of this argument to do, I suspect that we should find several
occasions when Christendom was thus to all appearance hollowed out
from within by doubt and indifference, so that only the old Christian
shell stood as the pagan shell had stood so long. But the difference is
that in every such case, the sons were fanatical for the faith where
the fathers had been slack about it. This is obvious in the case of
the transition from the Renaissance to the Counter-Reformation. It is
obvious in the case of a transition from the eighteenth century to
the many Catholic revivals of our own time. But I suspect many other
examples which would be worthy of separate studies.

The Faith is not a survival. It is not as if the Druids had managed
somehow to survive somewhere for two thousand years. That is what
might have happened in Asia or ancient Europe, in that indifference or
tolerance in which mythologies and philosophies could live for ever
side by side. It has not survived; it has returned again and again
in this Western world of rapid change and institutions perpetually
perishing. Europe, in the tradition of Rome, was always trying
revolution and reconstruction; rebuilding a universal republic. And it
always began by rejecting this old stone and ended by making it the
head of the corner; by bringing it back from the rubbish-heap to make
it the crown of the capitol. Some stones of Stonehenge are standing and
some are fallen; and as the stone falleth so shall it lie. There has
not been a Druidic renaissance every century or two, with the young
Druids crowned with fresh mistletoe, dancing in the sun on Salisbury
Plain. Stonehenge has not been rebuilt in every style of architecture
from the rude round Norman to the last rococo of the Baroque. The
sacred place of the Druids is safe from the vandalism of restoration.

But the Church in the West was not in a world where things were too
old to die; but in one in which they were always young enough to get
killed. The consequence was that superficially and externally it often
did get killed; nay, it sometimes wore out even without getting killed.
And there follows a fact I find it somewhat difficult to describe, yet
which I believe to be very real and rather important. As a ghost is the
shadow of a man, and in that sense the shadow of life, so at intervals
there passed across this endless life a sort of shadow of death. It
came at the moment when it would have perished had it been perishable.
It withered away everything that was perishable. If such animal
parallels were worthy of the occasion we might say that the snake
shuddered and shed a skin and went on, or even that the cat went into
convulsions as it lost only one of its nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine
lives. It is truer to say, in a more dignified image, that a clock
struck and nothing happened; or that a bell tolled for an execution
that was everlastingly postponed.

What was the meaning of all that dim but vast unrest of the twelfth
century; when, as it has been so finely said, Julian stirred in his
sleep? Why did there appear so strangely early, in the twilight of
dawn after the Dark Ages, so deep a scepticism as that involved in
urging nominalism against realism? For realism against nominalism was
really realism against rationalism, or something more destructive
than what we call rationalism. The answer is that just as some might
have thought the Church simply a part of the Roman Empire, so others
later might have thought the Church only a part of the Dark Ages. The
Dark Ages ended as the Empire had ended, and the Church should have
departed with them, if she had been also one of the shades of night. It
was another of those spectral deaths or simulations of death. I mean
that if nominalism had succeeded, it would have been as if Arianism
had succeeded, it would have been the beginning of a confession that
Christianity had failed. For nominalism is a far more fundamental
scepticism than mere atheism. Such was the question that was openly
asked as the Dark Ages broadened into that daylight that we call the
modern world. But what was the answer? The answer was Aquinas in the
chair of Aristotle, taking all knowledge for his province; and tens
of thousands of lads down to the lowest ranks of peasant and serf,
living in rags and on crusts about the great colleges, to listen to the
scholastic philosophy.

What was the meaning of all that whisper of fear that ran round the
west under the shadow of Islam, and fills every old romance with
incongruous images of Saracen knights swaggering in Norway or the
Hebrides? Why were men in the extreme west, such as King John if
I remember rightly, accused of being secretly Moslems, as men are
accused of being secretly atheists? Why was there that fierce alarm
among some of the authorities about the rationalistic Arab version of
Aristotle? Authorities are seldom alarmed like that except when it is
too late. The answer is that hundreds of people probably believed in
their hearts that Islam would conquer Christendom; that Averroes was
more rational than Anselm; that the Saracen Culture was really, as it
was superficially, a superior culture. Here again we should probably
find a whole generation, the older generation, serve doubtful and
depressed and weary. The coming of Islam would only have been the
coming of Unitarianism a thousand years before its time. To many it
may have seemed quite reasonable and quite probable and quite likely
to happen. If so, they would have been surprised at what did happen.
What did happen was a roar like thunder from thousands and thousands of
young men, throwing all their youth into one exultant counter-charge,
the Crusades. It was the sons of St. Francis, the Jugglers of God,
wandering singing over all the roads of the world; it was the Gothic
going up like a flight of arrows; it was the waking of the world. In
considering the war of the Albigensians, we come to the breach in the
heart of Europe and the landslide of a new philosophy that nearly ended
Christendom for ever. In that case the new philosophy was also a very
new philosophy; it was pessimism. It was none the less like modern
ideas because it was as old as Asia; most modern ideas are. It was the
Gnostics returning; but why did the Gnostics return? Because it was the
end of an epoch, like the end of the Empire; and should have been the
end of the Church. It was Schopenhauer hovering over the future; but it
was also Manichaeus rising from the dead; that men might have death and
that they might have it more abundantly.

It is rather more obvious in the case of the Renaissance, simply
because the period is so much nearer to us and people know so much
more about it. But there is more even in that example than most
people know. Apart from the particular controversies which I wish to
reserve for a separate study, the period was far more chaotic that
those controversies commonly imply. When Protestants call Latimer
a martyr to Protestantism, and Catholics reply that Campion was a
martyr to Catholicism, it is often forgotten that many who perished
in such persecutions could only be described as martyrs to atheism or
anarchism or even diabolism. That world was almost as wild as our own;
the men wandering about in it included the sort of man who says there
is no God, the sort of man who says he is himself God, the sort of man
who says something that nobody can make head or tail of. If we could
have the conversation of the age following the Renaissance, we should
probably be shocked by its shameless negations. The remarks attributed
to Marlowe are probably pretty typical of the talk in many intellectual
taverns. The transition from Pre-Reformation to Post-Reformation Europe
was through a void of very yawning questions; yet again in the long run
the answer was the same. It was one of those moments when, as Christ
walked on the water, so was Christianity walking in the air.

But all these cases are remote in date and could only be proved in
detail. We can see the fact much more clearly in the case when the
paganism of the Renaissance ended Christianity and Christianity
unaccountably began all over again. But we can see it most clearly of
all in the case which is close to us and full of manifest and minute
evidence; the case of the great decline of religion that began about
the time of Voltaire. For indeed it is our own case, and we ourselves
have seen the decline of that decline. The two hundred years since
Voltaire do not flash past us at a glance like the fourth and fifth
centuries or the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. In our own case we
can see this oft-repeated process close at hand; we know how completely
a society can lose its fundamental religion without abolishing its
official religion; we know how men can all become agnostics long before
they abolish bishops. And we know that also in this last ending, which
really did look to us like the final ending, the incredible thing has
happened again; the Faith has a better following among the young men
than among the old. When Ibsen spoke of the new generation knocking at
the door, he certainly never expected that it would be the church-door.

At least five times, therefore, with the Arian and the Albigensian,
with the Humanist sceptic, after Voltaire and after Darwin, the Faith
has to all appearance gone to the dogs. In each of these five cases it
was the dog that died. How complete was the collapse and how strange
the reversal we can only see in detail in the case nearest to our own
time.

A thousand things have been said about the Oxford Movement and the
parallel French Catholic revival; but few have made us feel the
simplest fact about it; that it was a surprise. It was a puzzle as well
as a surprise; because it seemed to most people like a river turning
backwards from the sea and trying to climb back into the mountains. To
have read the literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
is to know that nearly everybody had come to take it for granted that
religion was a thing that would continually broaden like a river,
till it reached an infinite sea. Some of them expected it to go down
in a cataract of catastrophe, most of them expected it to widen into
an estuary of equality and moderation; but all of them thought its
returning on itself a prodigy as incredible as witchcraft. In other
words, most moderate people thought that faith like freedom would
be slowly broadened down, and some advanced people thought that it
would be very rapidly broadened down, not to say flattened out. All
that world of Guizot and Macaulay and the commercial and scientific
liberality was perhaps more certain than any men before or since about
the direction in which the world is going. People were so certain about
the direction that they only differed about the pace. Many anticipated
with alarm, and a few with sympathy, a Jacobin revolt that should
guillotine the Archbishop of Canterbury or a Chartist riot that should
hang the parsons on the lampposts. But it seemed like a convulsion
in nature that the Archbishop instead of losing his head should be
looking for his mitre; and that instead of diminishing the respect due
to parsons we should strengthen it to the respect due to priests. It
revolutionised their very vision of revolution; and turned their very
topsyturveydom topsyturvey.

In short, the whole world being divided about whether the stream was
going slower or faster, became conscious of something vague but vast
that was going against the stream. Both in fact and figure there is
something deeply disturbing about this, and that for an essential
reason. A dead thing can go with the stream, but only a living thing
can go against it. A dead dog can be lifted on the leaping water with
all the swiftness of a leaping hound; but only a live dog can swim
backwards. A paper boat can ride the rising deluge with all the airy
arrogance of a fairy ship, but if the fairy ship sails up stream it
is really rowed by the fairies. And among the things that merely went
with the tide of apparent progress and enlargement there was many a
demagogue or sophist whose wild gestures were in truth as lifeless as
the movement of a dead dog's limbs wavering in the eddying water; and
many a philosophy uncommonly like a paper boat, of the sort that it is
not difficult to knock into a cocked hat. But even the truly living
and even life-giving things that went with that stream did not thereby
prove that they were living or life-giving. It was this other force
that was unquestionably and unaccountably alive; the mysterious and
unmeasured energy that was thrusting back the river. That was felt to
be like the movement of some great monster; and it was none the less
clearly a living monster because most people thought it a prehistoric
monster. It was none the less an unnatural, an incongruous, and to some
a comic upheaval; as if the Great Sea Serpent had suddenly risen out of
the Round Pond--unless we consider the Sea Serpent as more likely to
live in the Serpentine. This flippant element in the fantasy must not
be missed, for it was one of the clearest testimonies to the unexpected
nature of the reversal. That age did really feel that a preposterous
quality in prehistoric animals belonged also to historic rituals;
that mitres and tiaras were like the horns or crests of antediluvian
creatures; and that appealing to a Primitive Church was like dressing
up as a Primitive Man.

The world is still puzzled by that movement; but most of all because
it still moves. I have said something elsewhere of the rather random
sort of reproaches that are still directed against it and its much
greater consequences; it is enough to say here that the more such
critics reproach it the less they explain it. In a sense it is my
concern here, if not to explain it, at least to suggest the direction
of the explanation; but above all, it is my concern to point out one
particular thing about it. And that is that it had all happened before;
and even many times before.

To sum up, in so far as it is true that recent centuries have seen an
attenuation of Christian doctrine, recent centuries have only seen
what the most remote centuries have seen. And even the modern example
has only ended as the medieval and pre-medieval examples ended. It is
already clear, and grows clearer every day, that it is not going to end
in the disappearance of the diminished creed; but rather in the return
of those parts of it that had really disappeared. It is going to end
as the Arian compromise ended, as the attempts at a compromise with
Nominalism and even with Albigensianism ended. But the point to seize
in the modern case, as in all the other cases is that what returns is
not in that sense a simplified theology; not according to that view a
purified theology; it is simply theology. It is that enthusiasm for
theological studies that marked the most doctrinal ages; it is the
divine science. An old Don with D. D. after his name may have become
the typical figure of a bore; but that was because he was himself
bored with his theology, not because he was excited about it. It was
precisely because he was admittedly more interested in the Latin of
Plautus than in the Latin of Augustine, in the Greek of Xenophon than
in the Greek of Chrysostom. It was precisely because he was more
interested in a dead tradition than in a decidedly living tradition. In
short, it was precisely because he was himself a type of the time in
which Christian faith was weak. It was not because men would not hail,
if they could, the wonderful and almost wild vision of a Doctor of
Divinity.

There are people who say they wish Christianity to remain as a spirit.
They mean, very literally, that they wish it to remain as a ghost.
But it is not going to remain as a ghost. What follows this process
of apparent death is not the lingerings of the shade; it is the
resurrection of the body. These people are quite prepared to shed pious
and reverential tears over the Sepulchre of the Son of Man; what they
are not prepared for is the Son of God walking once more upon the hills
of morning. These people, and indeed most people, were indeed by this
time quite accustomed to the idea that the old Christian candle-light
would fade into the light of common day. To many of them it did quite
honestly appear like that pale yellow flame of a candle when it is left
burning in daylight. It was all the more unexpected, and therefore all
the more unmistakable, that the seven branched candle-stick suddenly
towered to heaven like a miraculous tree and flamed until the sun
turned pale. But other ages have seen the day conquer the candle-light
and then the candle-light conquer the day. Again and again, before
our time, men have grown content with a diluted doctrine. And again
and again there has followed on that dilution, coming as out of the
darkness in a crimson cataract, the strength of the red original wine.
And we only say once more to-day as has been said many times by our
fathers: 'Long years and centuries ago own fathers or the founders of
our people drank, as they dreamed, of the blood of God. Long years and
centuries have passed since the strength of that giant vintage has been
anything but a legend of the age of giants. Centuries ago already is
the dark time of the second fermentation, when the wine of Catholicism
turned into the vinegar of Calvinism. Long since that bitter drink
has been itself diluted; rinsed out and washed away by the waters of
oblivion and the wave of the world. Never did we think to taste again
even that bitter tang of sincerity and the spirit, still less the
richer and the sweeter strength of the purple vineyards in our dreams
of the age of gold. Day by day and year by year we have lowered our
hopes and lessened our convictions; we have grown more and more used
to seeing those vats and vineyards overwhelmed in the water-floods and
the last savour and suggestion of that special element fading like a
stain of purple upon a sea of grey. We have grown used to dilution, to
dissolution, to a watering down that went on for ever. But 'Thou hast
kept the good wine until now.'

This is the final fact, and it is the most extraordinary of all. The
faith has not only often died but it has often died of old age. It has
not only been often killed but it has often died a natural death; in
the sense of coming to a natural and necessary end. It is obvious that
it has survived the most savage and the most universal persecutions
from the shock of the Diocletian fury to the shock of the French
Revolution. But it has a more strange and even a more weird tenacity;
it has survived not only war but peace. It has not only died often but
degenerated often and decayed often; it has survived its own weakness
and even its own surrender. We need not repeat what is so obvious about
the beauty of the end of Christ in its wedding of youth and death. But
this is almost as if Christ had lived to the last possible span, had
been a white-haired sage of a hundred and died of natural decay, and
then had risen again rejuvenated, with trumpets and the rending of the
sky. It was said truly enough that human Christianity in its recurrent
weakness was sometimes too much wedded to the powers of the world; but
if it was wedded it has very often been widowed. It is a strangely
immortal sort of widow. An enemy may have said at one moment that it
was but an aspect of the power of the Caesars; and it sounds as strange
to-day as to call it an aspect of the Pharaohs. An enemy might say that
it was the official faith of feudalism; and it sounds as convincing now
as to say that it was bound to perish with the ancient Roman villa. All
these things did indeed run their course to its normal end; and there
seemed no course for the religion but to end with them. It ended and it
began again.

'Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.'
The civilisation of antiquity was the whole world: and men no more
dreamed of its ending than of the ending of daylight. They could not
imagine another order unless it were in another world. The civilisation
of the world has passed away and those words have not passed away.
In the long night of the Dark Ages feudalism was so familiar a thing
that no man could imagine himself without a lord: and religion was so
woven into that network that no man would have believed they could be
torn asunder. Feudalism itself was torn to rags and rotted away in the
popular life of the true Middle Ages; and the first and freshest power
in that new freedom was the old religion. Feudalism had passed away,
and the words did not pass away. The whole medieval order, in many
ways so complete and almost cosmic a home for man, wore out gradually
in its turn and here at least it was thought that the words would die.
They went forth across the radiant abyss of the Renaissance and in
fifty years were using all its light and learning for new religious
foundations, new apologetics, new saints. It was supposed to have been
withered up at last in the dry light of the Age of Reason; it was
supposed to have disappeared ultimately in the earthquake of the Age of
Revolution. Science explained it away; and it was still there. History
disinterred it in the past; and it appeared suddenly in the future.
To-day it stands once more in our path; and even as we watch it, it
grows.

If our social relations and records retain their continuity, if men
really learn to apply reason to the accumulating facts of so crushing a
story, it would seem that sooner or later even its enemies will learn
from their incessant and interminable disappointments not to look for
anything so simple as its death. They may continue to war with it, but
it will be as they war with nature; as they war with the landscape,
as they war with the skies. 'Heaven and earth shall pass away, but
my words shall not pass away.' They will watch for it to stumble;
they will watch for it to err; they will no longer watch for it to
end. Insensibly, even unconsciously, they will in their own silent
anticipations fulfil the relative terms of that astounding prophecy;
they will forget to watch for the mere extinction of what has so often
been vainly extinguished; and will learn instinctively to look first
for the coming of the comet or the freezing of the star.

CONCLUSION

THE SUMMARY OF THIS BOOK

I have taken the liberty once or twice of borrowing the excellent
phrase about an Outline of History; though this study of a special
truth and a special error can of course claim no sort of comparison
with the rich and many-sided encyclopedia of history, for which that
name was chosen. And yet there is a certain reason in the reference:
and a sense in which the one thing touches and even cuts across the
other. For the story of the world as told by Mr. Wells could here only
be criticised as an outline. And, strangely enough, it seems to me that
it is only wrong as an outline. It is admirable as an accumulation of
history; it is splendid as a store-house or treasure of history; it
is a fascinating disquisition on history; it is most attractive as
an amplification of history; but it is quite false as an outline of
history. The one thing that seems to me quite wrong about it is the
outline; the sort of outline that can really be a single line, like
that which makes all the difference between a caricature of the profile
of Mr. Winston Churchill and of Sir Alfred Mond. In simple and homely
language, I mean the things that stick out; the things that make the
simplicity of a silhouette. I think the proportions are wrong; the
proportions of what is certain as compared with what is uncertain, of
what played a great part as compared with what played a smaller part,
of what is ordinary and what is extraordinary, of what really lies
level with an average and what stands out as an exception.

I do not say it as a small criticism of a great writer, and I have
no reason to do so; for in my own much smaller task I feel I have
failed in very much the same way. I am very doubtful whether I have
conveyed to the reader the main point I meant about the proportions of
history, and why I have dwelt so much more on some things than others.
I doubt whether I have clearly fulfilled the plan that I set out in the
introductory chapter; and for that reason I add these lines as a sort
of summary in a concluding chapter. I do believe that the things on
which I have insisted are more essential to an outline of history than
the things which I have subordinated or dismissed. I do not believe
that the past is most truly pictured as a thing in which humanity
merely fades away into nature, or civilisation merely fades away into
barbarism, or religion fades away into mythology, or our own religion
fades away into the religions of the world. In short I do not believe
that the best way to produce an outline of history is to rub out the
lines. I believe that, of the two, it would be far nearer the truth to
tell the tale very simply, like a primitive myth about a man who made
the sun and stars or a god who entered the body of a sacred monkey. I
will therefore sum up all that has gone before in what seems to me a
realistic and reasonably proportioned statement; the short story of
mankind.

In the land lit by that neighbouring star, whose blaze is the broad
daylight, there are many and very various things motionless and moving.
There moves among them a race that is in its relation to others a race
of gods. The fact is not lessened but emphasised because it can behave
like a race of demons. Its distinction is not an individual illusion,
like one bird pluming itself on its own plumes; it is a solid and a
many-sided thing. It is demonstrated in the very speculations that have
led to its being denied. That men, the gods of this lower world, are
linked with it in various ways is true; but it is another aspect of the
same truth. That they grow as the grass grows and walk as the beasts
walk is a secondary necessity that sharpens the primary distinction. It
is like saying that a magician must after all have the appearance of
a man; or that even the fairies could not dance without feet. It has
lately been the fashion to focus the mind entirely on these mild and
subordinate resemblances and to forget the main fact altogether. It is
customary to insist that man resembles the other creatures. Yes; and
that very resemblance he alone can see. The fish does not trace the
fish-bone pattern in the fowls of the air; or the elephant and the emu
compare skeletons. Even in the sense in which man is at one with the
universe it is an utterly lonely universality. The very sense that he
is united with all things is enough to sunder him from all.

Looking around him by this unique light, as lonely as the literal flame
that he alone has kindled, this demigod or demon of the visible world
makes that world visible. He sees around him a world of a certain style
or type. It seems to proceed by certain rules or at least repetitions.
He sees a green architecture that builds itself without visible hands;
but which builds itself into a very exact plan or pattern, like a
design already drawn in the air by an invisible finger. It is not,
as is now vaguely suggested, a vague thing. It is not a growth or a
groping of blind life. Each seeks an end; a glorious and radiant end,
even for every daisy or dandelion we see in looking across the level of
a common field. In the very shape of things there is more than green
growth; there is the finality of the flower. It is a world of crowns.
This impression, whether or no it be an illusion, has so profoundly
influenced this race of thinkers and masters of the material world,
that the vast majority have been moved to take a certain view of that
world. They have concluded, rightly or wrongly, that the world had
a plan as the tree seemed to have a plan; and an end and crown like
the flower. But so long as the race of thinkers was able to think, it
was obvious that the admission of this idea of a plan brought with it
another thought more thrilling and even terrible. There was someone
else, some strange and unseen being, who had designed these things,
if indeed they were designed. There was a stranger who was also a
friend; a mysterious benefactor who had been before them and built
up the woods and hills for their coming, and had kindled the sunrise
against their rising, as a servant kindles a fire. Now this idea of a
mind that gives a meaning to the universe has received more and more
confirmation within the minds of men, by meditations and experiences
much more subtle and searching than any such argument about the
external plan of the world. But I am concerned here with keeping the
story in its most simple and even concrete terms; and it is enough to
say here that most men, including the wisest men, have come to the
conclusion that the world has such a final purpose and therefore such
a first cause. But most men in some sense separated themselves from
the wisest men, when it came to the treatment of that idea. There came
into existence two ways of treating that idea, which between them made
up most of the religious history of the world. The majority, like the
minority, had this strong sense of a second meaning in things; of a
strange master who knew the secret of the world. But the majority,
the mob or mass of men, naturally tended to treat it rather in the
spirit of gossip. The gossip, like all gossip, contained a great deal
of truth and falsehood. The world began to tell itself tales about the
unknown being or his sons or servants or messengers. Some of the tales
may truly be called old wives' tales; as professing only to be very
remote memories of the morning of the world; myths about the baby moon
or the half-baked mountains. Some of them might more truly be called
travellers' tales; as being curious but contemporary tales brought from
certain borderlands of experience; such as miraculous cures or those
that bring whispers of what has happened to the dead. Many of them
are probably true tales; enough of them are probably true to keep a
person of real commonsense more or less conscious that there really is
something rather marvellous behind the cosmic curtain. But in a sense
it is only going by appearances; even if the appearances are called
apparitions. It is a matter of appearances--and disappearances. At the
most these gods are ghosts; that is, they are glimpses. For most of
us they are rather gossip about glimpses. And for the rest, the whole
world is full of rumours, most of which are almost avowedly romances.
The great majority of the tales about gods and ghosts and the invisible
king are told, if not for the sake of the tale, at least for the sake
of the topic. They are evidence of the eternal interest of the theme;
they are not evidence of anything else, and they are not meant to be.
They are mythology or the poetry that is not bound in books--or bound
in any other way.

Meanwhile the minority, the sages or thinkers, had withdrawn apart and
had taken up an equally congenial trade. They were drawing up plans of
the world; of the world which all believed to have a plan. They were
trying to set forth the plan seriously and to scale. They were setting
their minds directly to the mind that had made the mysterious world;
considering what sort of a mind it might be and what its ultimate
purpose might be. Some of them made that mind much more impersonal
than mankind has generally made it; some simplified it almost to a
blank; a few, a very few, doubted it altogether. One or two of the more
morbid fancied that it might be evil and an enemy; just one or two
of the more degraded in the other class worshipped demons instead of
gods. But most of these theorists were theists: and they not only saw
a moral plan in nature, but they generally laid down a moral plan for
humanity. Most of them were good men who did good work: and they were
remembered and reverenced in various ways. They were scribes; any their
scriptures became more or less holy scriptures. They were law-givers;
and their tradition became not only legal but ceremonial. We may say
that they received divine honours, in the sense in which kings and
great captains in certain countries often received divine honours. In
a word, wherever the other popular spirit, the spirit of legend and
gossip could come into play, it surrounded them with the more mystical
atmosphere of the myths. Popular poetry turned the sages into saints.
But that was all it did. They remained themselves; men never really
forgot that they were men, only made into gods in the sense that they
were made into heroes. Divine Plato, like Divus Ceasar, was a title
and not a dogma. In Asia, where the atmosphere was more mythological,
the man was made to look more like a myth, but he remained a man. He
remained a man of a certain social class or school of men, receiving
and deserving great honour from mankind. It is the order or school of
the philosophers; the men who have set themselves seriously to trace
the order across any apparent chaos in the vision of life. Instead of
living on imaginative rumours and remote traditions and the tail-end of
exceptional experiences about the mind and meaning behind the world,
they have tried in a sense to project the primary purpose of that mind
a priori. They have tried to put on paper a possible plan of the world;
almost as if the world were not yet made.

Right in the middle of all these things stands up an enormous
exception. It is quite unlike anything else. It is a thing final like
the trump of doom, though it is also a piece of good news; or news
that seems too good to be true. It is nothing less than the loud
assertion that this mysterious maker of the world has visited his
world in person. It declares that really and even recently, or right
in the middle of historic times, there did walk into the world this
original invisible being; about whom the thinkers make theories and the
mythologists hand down myths; the Man Who Made the World. That such
a higher personality exists behind all things had indeed always been
implied by all the best thinkers, as well as by all the most beautiful
legends. But nothing of this sort had ever been implied in any of them.
It is simply false to say that the other sages and heroes had claimed
to be that mysterious master and maker, of whom the world had dreamed
and disputed. Not one of them had ever claimed to be anything of the
sort. Not one of their sects or schools had even claimed that they had
claimed to be anything of the sort. The most that any religious prophet
had said was that he was the true servant of such a being. The most
that any visionary had ever said was that men might catch glimpses
of the glory of that spiritual being; or much more often of lesser
spiritual beings. The most that any primitive myth had even suggested
was that the Creator was present at the Creation. But that the Creator
was present at scenes a little subsequent to the supper-parties of
Horace, and talked with tax-collectors and government officials in the
detailed daily life of the Roman Empire, and that this fact continued
to be firmly asserted by the whole of that great civilisation for more
than a thousand years--that is something utterly unlike anything else
in nature. It is the one great startling statement that man has made
since he spoke his first articulate word, instead of barking like a
dog. Its unique character can be used as an argument against it as well
as for it. It would be easy to concentrate on it as a case of isolated
insanity; but it makes nothing but dust and nonsense of comparative
religion.

It came on the world with a wind and rush of running messengers
proclaiming that apocalyptic portent, and it is not unduly fanciful
to say that they are running still. What puzzles the world, and its
wise philosophers and fanciful pagan poets, about the priests and
people of the Catholic Church is that they still behave as if they
were messengers. A messenger does not dream about what his message
might be, or argue about what it probably would be; he delivers it as
it is. It is not a theory or a fancy but a fact. It is not relevant to
this intentionally rudimentary outline to prove in detail that it is
a fact; but merely to point out that these messengers do deal with it
as men deal with a fact. All that is condemned in Catholic tradition,
authority, and dogmatism and the refusal to retract and modify, are
but the natural human attributes of a man with a message relating to
a fact. I desire to avoid in this last summary all the controversial
complexities that may once more cloud the simple lines of that strange
story; which I have already called, in words that are much too weak,
the strangest story in the world. I desire merely to mark those main
lines and specially to mark where the great line is really to be
drawn. The religion of the world, in its right proportions, is not
divided into fine shades of mysticism or more or less rational forms of
mythology. It is divided by the line between the men who are bringing
that message and the men who have not yet heard it, or cannot yet
believe it.

But when we translate the terms of that strange tale back into the
more concrete and complicated terminology of our time, we find it
covered by names and memories of which the very familiarity is a
falsification. For instance, when we say that a country contains so
many Moslems, we really mean that it contains so many monotheists;
and we really mean, by that, that it contains so many men; men with
the old average assumption of men--that the invisible ruler remains
invisible. They hold it along with the customs of a certain culture
and under the simpler laws of a certain law-giver; but so they would
if their law-giver were Lycurgus or Solon. They testify to something
which is a necessary and noble truth; but was never a new truth. Their
creed is not a new colour; it is the neutral and normal tint that is
the background of the many-coloured life of man. Mahomet did not, like
the Magi, find a new star; he saw through his own particular window
a glimpse of the great grey field of the ancient starlight. So when
we say that the country contains so many Confucians or Buddhists,
we mean it contains so many pagans whose prophets have given them
another and rather vaguer version of the invisible power; making it
not only invisible but almost impersonal. When we say that they also
have temples and idols and priests and periodical festivals, we simply
mean that this sort of heathen is enough of a human being to admit the
popular element of pomp and pictures and feasts and fairy-tales. We
only mean that Pagans have more sense than Puritans. But what the gods
are supposed to be, what the priests are commissioned to say, is not a
sensational secret like what those running messengers of the Gospel had
to say. Nobody else except those messengers has any Gospel; nobody else
has any good news; for the simple reason that nobody else has any news.

Those runners gather impetus as they run. Ages afterwards they still
speak as if something had just happened. They have not lost the speed
and momentum of messengers; they have hardly lost, as it were, the wild
eyes of witnesses. In the Catholic Church, which is the cohort of the
message, there are still those headlong acts of holiness that speak of
something rapid and recent; a self-sacrifice that startles the world
like a suicide. But it is not a suicide; it is not pessimistic; it is
still as optimistic as St. Francis of the flowers and birds. It is
newer in spirit than the newest schools of thought; and it is almost
certainly on the eve of new triumphs. For these men serve a mother who
seems to grow more beautiful as new generations rise up and call her
blessed. We might sometimes fancy that the Church grows younger as the
world grows old.

For this is the last proof of the miracle; that something so
supernatural should have become so natural. I mean that anything so
unique when seen from the outside should only seem universal when
seen from the inside. I have not minimised the scale of the miracle,
as some of our wilder theologians think it wise to do. Rather have I
deliberately dwelt on that incredible interruption, as a blow that
broke the very backbone of history. I have great sympathy with the
monotheists, the Moslems, or the Jews, to whom it seems a blasphemy; a
blasphemy that might shake the world. But it did not shake the world;
it steadied the world. That fact, the more we consider it, will seem
more solid and more strange. I think it a piece of plain justice to all
the unbelievers to insist upon the audacity of the act of faith that is
demanded of them. I willingly and warmly agree that it is, in itself, a
suggestion at which we might expect even the brain of the believer to
reel, when he realised his own belief. But the brain of the believer
does not reel; it is the brains of the unbelievers that reel. We can
see their brains reeling on every side and into every extravagance of
ethics and psychology; into pessimism and the denial of life; into
pragmatism and the denial of logic; seeking their omens in nightmares
and their canons in contradictions; shrieking for fear at the far-off
sight of things beyond good and evil, or whispering of strange stars
where two and two make five. Meanwhile this solitary thing that seems
at first so outrageous in outline remains solid and sane in substance.
It remains the moderator of all these manias; rescuing reason from
the Pragmatists exactly as it rescued laughter from the Puritans. I
repeat that I have deliberately emphasised its intrinsically defiant
and dogmatic character. The mystery is how anything so startling should
have remained defiant and dogmatic and yet become perfectly normal
and natural. I have admitted freely that, considering the incident in
itself, a man who says he is God may be classed with a man who says
he is glass. But the man who says he is glass is not a glazier making
windows for all the world. He does not remain for after ages as a
shining and crystalline figure, in whose light everything is as clear
as crystal.

But this madness has remained sane. The madness has remained sane when
everything else went mad. The madhouse has been a house to which, age
after age, men are continually coming back as to a home. That is the
riddle that remains; that anything so abrupt and abnormal should still
be found a habitable and hospitable thing. I care not if the sceptic
says it is a tall story; I cannot see how so toppling a tower could
stand so long without foundation. Still less can I see how it could
become, as it has become, the home of man. Had it merely appeared
and disappeared, it might possibly have been remembered or explained
as the last leap of the rage of illusion, the ultimate myth of the
ultimate mood, in which the mind struck the sky and broke. But the
mind did not break. It is the one mind that remains unbroken in the
break-up of the world. If it were an error, it seems as if the error
could hardly have lasted a day. If it were a mere ecstasy, it would
seem that such an ecstasy could not endure for an hour. It has endured
for nearly two thousand years; and the world within it has been more
lucid, more level-headed, more reasonable in its hopes, more healthy
in its instincts, more humorous and cheerful in the face of fate and
death, than all the world outside. For it was the soul of Christendom
that came forth from the incredible Christ; and the soul of it was
common sense. Though we dared not look on His face we could look on
His fruits; and by His fruits we should know Him. The fruits are solid
and the fruitfulness is much more than a metaphor; and nowhere in this
sad world are boys happier in apple-trees, or men in more equal chorus
singing as they tread the vine, than under the fixed flash of this
instant and intolerant enlightenment; the lightning made eternal as the
light.

APPENDIX I

ON PREHISTORIC MAN

On re-reading these pages I feel that I have tried in many places and
with many words, to say something that might be said in one word. In
a sense this study is meant to be superficial. That is, it is not
meant as a study of the things that need to be studied. It is rather
a reminder of the things that are seen so quickly that they are
forgotten almost as quickly. Its moral, in a manner of speaking, is
that first thoughts are best; so a flash might reveal a landscape; with
the Eiffel Tower or the Matterhorn standing up in it as they would
never stand up again in the light of common day. I ended the book with
an image of everlasting lightning; in a very different sense, alas,
this little flash has lasted only too long. But the method has also
certain practical disadvantages upon which I think it well to add
these two notes. It may seem to simplify too much and to ignore out of
ignorance. I feel this especially in the passage about the prehistoric
pictures; which is not concerned with all that the learned may learn
from prehistoric pictures, but with the single point of what anyone
could learn from there being any prehistoric pictures at all. I am
conscious that this attempt to express it in terms of innocence may
exaggerate even my own ignorance. Without any pretence of scientific
research or information, I should be sorry to have it thought that I
knew no more than what was needed, in that passage, of the states into
which primitive humanity has been divided. I am aware, of course, that
the story is elaborately stratified; and that there were many such
stages before the Cro-Magnon or any peoples with whom we associate
such pictures. Indeed recent studies about the Neanderthal and other
races rather tend to repeat the moral that is here most relevant. The
notion noted in these pages of something necessarily slow or late
in the development of religion, will gain little indeed from these
later revelations about the precursors of the reindeer picture-maker.
The learned appear to hold that, whether the reindeer picture could
be religious or not, the people that lived before it were religious
already; burying their dead with the significant signs of mystery and
hope. This obviously brings us back to the same argument; an argument
that is not approached by any measurement of the earlier man's skull.
It is little use here to compare the head of the man with the head of
the monkey, if it certainly never came into the head of the monkey
to bury another monkey with nuts in his grave to help him towards a
heavenly monkey house. Talking of skulls, I am also aware of the story
of the Cro-Magnon skull that was much larger and finer than a modern
skull. It is a very funny story; because an eminent evolutionist,
awakening to a somewhat belated caution, protested against anything
being inferred from one specimen. It is the duty of a solitary skull to
prove that our fathers were our inferiors. Any solitary skull presuming
to prove that they were superior is felt to be suffering from swelled
head.

APPENDIX II

ON AUTHORITY AND ACCURACY

In this book which is merely meant as a popular criticism of popular
fallacies, often indeed of very vulgar errors, I feel that I have
sometimes given an impression of scoffing at serious scientific work.
It was however the very reverse of my intentions. I am not arguing with
the scientist who explains the elephant, but only with the sophist
who explains it away. And as a matter of fact the sophist plays to
the gallery, as he did in ancient Greece. He appeals to the ignorant,
especially when he appeals to the learned. But I never meant my own
criticism to be an impertinence to the truly learned. We all owe an
infinite debt to the researches, especially the recent researches, of
single minded students in these matters; and I have only professed to
pick up things here and there from them. I have not loaded my abstract
argument with quotations and references, which only make a man look
more learned than he is; but in some cases I find that my own loose
fashion of allusion is rather misleading about my own meaning. The
passage about Chaucer and the Child Martyr is badly expressed; I only
mean that the English poet probably had in mind the English saint; of
whose story he gives a sort of foreign version. In the same way two
statements in the chapter on Mythology follow each other in such a way
that it may seem to be suggested that the second story about monotheism
refers to the Southern Seas. I may explain that Atahocan belongs not
to Australasian but to American savages. So in the chapter called "The
Antiquity of Civilisation," which I feel to be the most unsatisfactory,
I have given my own impression of the meaning of the development of
Egyptian monarchy too much, perhaps, as if it were identical with the
facts on which it was formed as given in works like those of Professor
J. L Myres. But the confusion was not intentional; still less was there
any intention to imply, in the remainder of the chapter, that the
anthropological speculations about races are less valuable than they
undoubtedly are. My criticism is strictly relative; I may say that the
pyramids are plainer than the tracks of the desert; without denying
that wiser men than I may see tracks in what is to me the trackless
sand.
