THE COLD EMBRACE

He was an artist--such things as happened to him happen sometimes to artists.

He was a German--such things as happened to him happen sometimes to Germans.

He was young, handsome, studious, enthusiastic, metaphysical, reckless,
unbelieving, heartless.

And being young, handsome and eloquent, he was beloved.

He was an orphan, under the guardianship of his dead father's brother,
his uncle Wilhelm, in whose house he had brought up from a little
child; and she who loved him was his cousin--his cousin Gertrude, whom
he swore he loved in return.

Did he love her? Yes, when he first swore it. It soon wore out, this
passionate love; how threadbare and wretched a sentiment it became at
last in the selfish heart of the student! But in its first golden
dawn, when he was only nineteen, and had just returned from his
apprenticeship to a great painter at Antwerp, and they wandered
together in the most romantic outskirts of the city at rosy sunset, by
holy moonlight, or bright and joyous morning, how beautiful a dream!

They keep it a secret from Wilhelm, as he has the father's ambition of
a wealthy suitor for his only child--a cold and dreary vision beside
the lover's dream.

So they are betrothed; and standing side by side when the dying sun
and the pale rising moon divide the heavens, he puts the betrothal
ring upon her finger, the white and taper finger whose slender shape
he knows so well. This ring is a peculiar one, a massive golden
serpent, its tail in its mouth, the symbol of eternity; it had been
his mother's, and he would know it amongst a thousand. If he were to
become blind tomorrow, he could select it from amongst a thousand by
the touch alone.

He places it on her finger, and they swear to be true to each other
for ever and ever--through trouble and danger--sorrow and change---in
wealth or poverty. Her father must needs be won to consent to their
union by-and-by, for they were now betrothed, and death alone could
part them.

But the young student, the scoffer at revelation, yet the enthusiastic
adorer of the mystical asks:

'Can death part us? I would return to you from the grave, Gertrude. My
soul would come back to be near my love. And you--you, if you died
before me--the cold earth would not hold you from me; if you loved me,
you would return, and again these fair arms would be clasped round my
neck as they are now.'

But she told him, with a holier light in her deep-blue eyes than had
ever shone in his--she told him that the dead who die at peace with
God are happy in heaven, and cannot return to the troubled earth; and
that it is only the suicide--the lost wretch on whom sorrowful angels
shut the door of Paradise--whose unholy spirit haunts the footsteps of
the living.

The first year of their betrothal is passed, and she is alone, for he
has gone to Italy, on a commission for some rich man, to copy
Raphaels, Titians, Guidos, in a gallery at Florence. He has gone to
win fame, perhaps; but it is not the less bitter--he is gone!

Of course her father misses his young nephew, who has been as a son to
him; and he thinks his daughter's sadness no more than a cousin should
feel for a cousin's absence.

In the meantime, the weeks and months pass. The lover writes--often at
first, then seldom--at last, not at all.

How many excuses she invents for him! How many times she goes to the
distant little post-office, to which he is to address his letters! How
many times she hopes, only to be disappointed!

How many times she despairs, only to hope again!

But real despair comes at last, and will not be put off any more. The
rich suitor appears on the scene, and her father is determined. She is
to marry at once. The wedding-day is fixed--the fifteenth of June.

The date seems burnt into her brain.

The date, written in fire, dances for ever before her eyes.

The date, shrieked by the Furies, sounds continually in her ears.

But there is time yet--it is the middle of May--there is time for a
letter to reach him at Florence; there is time for him to come to
Brunswick, to take her away and marry her, in spite of her father--in
spite of the whole world.

But the days and weeks fly by, and he does not write--he does not
come. This is indeed despair which usurps her heart, and will not be
put away.

It is the fourteenth of June. For the last time she goes to the little
post-office; for the last time she asks the old question, and they
give her for the last time the dreary answer, 'No; no letter.'

For the last time--for tomorrow is the day appointed for her bridal.
Her father will hear no entreaties; her rich suitor will not listen to
her prayers. They will not be put off a day--an hour; tonight alone is
hers--this night, which she may employ as she will.

She takes another path than that which leads home; she hurries through
some by-streets of the city, out on to a lonely bridge, where he and
she had stood so often in the sunset, watching the rose-coloured light
glow, fade, and die upon the river.

He returns from Florence. He had received her letter. That letter,
blotted with tears, entreating, despairing--he had received it, but he
loved her no longer. A young Florentine, who has sat to him for a
model, had bewitched his fancy--that fancy which with him stood in
place of a heart---and Gertrude had been half-forgotten. If she had a
rich suitor, good; let her marry him; better for her, better far for
himself. He had no wish to fetter himself with a wife. Had he not his
art always?--his eternal bride, his unchanging mistress.

Thus he thought it wiser to delay his journey to Brunswick, so that he
should arrive when the wedding was over--arrive in time to salute the
bride.

And the vows--the mystical fancies--the belief in his return, even
after death, to the embrace of his beloved? O, gone out of his life;
melted away for ever, those foolish dreams of his boyhood.

So on the fifteenth of June he enters Brunswick, by that very bridge
on which she stood, the stars looking down on her, the night before.
He strolls across the bridge and down by the water's edge, a great
rough dog at his heels, and the smoke from his short meerschaum-pipe
curling in blue wreaths fantastically in the pure morning air. He has
his sketch-book under his arm, and attracted now and then by some
object that catches his artist's eye, stops to draw: a few weeds and
pebbles on the river's brink--a crag on the opposite shore--a group of
pollard willows in the distance. When he has done, he admires his
drawing, shuts his sketch-book, empties the ashes from his pipe,
refills from his tobacco-pouch, sings the refrain of a gay drinking-
song, calls to his dog, smokes again, and walks on. Suddenly he opens
his sketch-book again; this time that which attracts him is a group of
figures: but what is it? It is not a funeral, for there are no
mourners.

It is not a funeral, but a corpse lying on a rough bier, covered with
an old sail, carried between two bearers.

It is not a funeral, for the bearers are fishermen--fishermen in their
everyday garb.

About a hundred yards from him they rest their burden on a bank---one
stands at the head of the bier, the other throws himself down at the
foot of it.

And thus they form a perfect group; he walks back two or three paces,
selects his point of sight, and begins to sketch a hurried outline. He
has finished it before they move; he hears their voices, though he
cannot hear their words, and wonders what they can be talking of.
Presently he walks on and joins them.

'You have a corpse there, my friends?' he says.

'Yes; a corpse washed ashore an hour ago.'

'Drowned?'

'Yes, drowned. A young girl, very handsome.'

'Suicides are always handsome,' says the painter; and then he stands
for a little while idly smoking and meditating, looking at the sharp
outline of the corpse and the stiff folds of the rough canvas
covering.

Life is such a golden holiday for him--young, ambitious, clever---that
it seems as though sorrow and death could have no part in his destiny.

At last he says that, as this poor suicide is so handsome, he should
like to make a sketch of her.

He gives the fishermen some money, and they offer to remove the
sailcloth that covers her features.

No; he will do it himself. He lifts the rough, coarse, wet canvas from
her face. What face?

The face that shone on the dreams of his foolish boyhood; the face
which once was the light of his uncle's home. His cousin Gertrude---
his betrothed!

He sees, as in one glance, while he draws one breath, the rigid
features--the marble arms--the hands crossed on the cold bosom; and,
on the third finger of the left hand, the ring which had been his
mother's--the golden serpent; the ring which, if he were to become
blind, he could select from a thousand others by the touch alone.

But he is a genius and a metaphysician--grief, true grief, is not for
such as he. His first thought is flight--flight anywhere out of that
accursed city--anywhere far from the brink of that hideous river---
anywhere away from remorse--anywhere to forget.

He is miles on the road that leads away from Brunswick before he knows
that he has walked a step.

It is only when his dog lies down panting at his feet than he feels
how exhausted he is himself, and sits down upon a bank to rest. How
the landscape spins round and round before his dazzled eves, while his
morning's sketch of the two fishermen and the canvas-covered bier
glares redly at him out of the twilight!

At last, after sitting a long time by the roadside, idly playing with
his dog, idly smoking, idly lounging, looking as any idle, light-
hearted travelling student might look, yet all the while acting over
that morning's scene in his burning brain a hundred times a minute; at
last he grows a little more composed, and tries presently to think of
himself as he is, apart from his cousin's suicide.

Apart from that, he was no worse off than he was yesterday. His genius
was not gone; the money he had earned at Florence still lined his
pocket-book; he was his own master, free to go whither he would.

And while he sits on the roadside, trying to separate himself from the
scene of that morning---trying to put away the image of the corpse
covered with the damp canvas sail--trying to think of what he should
do next, where he should go, to be farthest away from Brunswick and
remorse, the old diligence comes rumbling and jingling along. He
remembers it; it goes from Brunswick to Aix-la-Chapelle.

He whistles to his dog, shouts to the postillion to stop, and springs
into the coupé.

During the whole evening, through the long night, though he does not
once close his eyes, he never speaks a word; but when morning dawns,
and the other passengers awake and begin to talk to each other, he
joins in the conversation. He tells them that he is an artist, that he
is going to Cologne and to Antwerp to copy Rubenses, and the great
picture by Quentin Matsys, in the museum. He remembered afterwards
that he talked and laughed boisterously, and that when he was talking
and laughing loudest, a passenger, older and graver than the rest,
opened the window near him, and told him to put his head out. He
remembered the fresh air blowing in his face, the singing of the birds
in his ears, and the flat fields and roadside reeling before his eyes.
He remembered this, and then falling in a lifeless heap on the floor
of the diligence.

It is a fever that keeps him for six long weeks on a bed at a hotel in
Aix-la-Chapelle.

He gets well, and, accompanied by his dog, starts on foot for Cologne.
By this time he is his former self once more. Again the blue smoke
from his short meerschaum curls upwards in the morning air--again he
sings some old university drinking-song--again stops here and there,
meditating and sketching.

He is happy, and has forgotten his cousin--and so on to Cologne.

It is by the great cathedral he is standing, with his dog at his side.
It is night, the bells have just chimed the hour, and the clocks are
striking eleven; the moonlight shines full upon the magnificent pile,
over which the artist's eye wanders, absorbed in the beauty of form.

He is not thinking of his drowned cousin, for he has forgotten her and
is happy.

Suddenly some one, something from behind him, puts two cold arms round
his neck, and clasps its hands on his breast.

And yet there is no one behind him, for on the flags bathed in the
broad moonlight there are only two shadows, his own and his dog's. He
turns quickly round--there is no one--nothing to be seen in the broad
square but himself and his dog; and though he feels, he cannot see the
cold arms clasped round his neck.

It is not ghostly, this embrace, for it is palpable to the touch--it
cannot be real, for it is invisible.

He tries to throw off the cold caress. He clasps the hands in his own
to tear them asunder, and to cast them off his neck. He can feel the
long delicate fingers cold and wet beneath his touch, and on the third
finger of the left hand he can feel the ring which was his mother's--
the golden serpent--the ring which he has always said he would know
among a thousand by the touch alone. He knows it now!

His dead cousin's cold arms are round his neck--his dead cousin's wet
hands are clasped upon his breast. He asks himself if he is mad. 'Up,
Leo!' he shouts. 'Up, up, boy!' and the Newfoundland leaps to his
shoulders--the dog's paws are on the dead hands, and the animal utters
a terrific howl, and springs away from his master.

The student stands in the moonlight, the dead arms around his neck,
and the dog at a little distance moaning piteously.

Presently a watchman, alarmed by the howling of the dog, comes into
the square to see what is wrong.

In a breath the cold arms are gone.

He takes the watchman home to the hotel with him and gives him money;
in his gratitude he could have given that man half his little fortune.

Will it ever come to him again, this embrace of the dead?

He tries never to be alone; he makes a hundred acquaintances, and
shares the chamber of another student. He starts up if he is left by
himself in the public room at the inn where he is staying, and runs
into the street. People notice his strange actions, and begin to think
that he is mad.

But, in spite of all, he is alone once more; for one night the public
room being empty for a moment, when on some idle pretence he strolls
into the street, the street is empty too, and for the second time he
feels the cold arms round his neck, and for the second time, when he
calls his dog, the animal slinks away from him with a piteous howl.

After this he leaves Cologne, still travelling on foot--of necessity
now, for his money is getting low. He joins travelling hawkers, he
walks side by side with labourers, he talks to every foot-passenger he
falls in with, and tries from morning till night to get company on the
road.

At night he sleeps by the fire in the kitchen of the inn at which he
stops; but do what he will, he is often alone, and it is now a common
thing for him to feel the cold arms around his neck.

Many months have passed since his cousin's death--autumn, winter,
early spring. His money is nearly gone, his health is utterly broken,
he is the shadow of his former self, and he is getting near to Paris.
He will reach that city at the time of the Carnival. To this he looks
forward. In Paris, in Carnival time, he need never, surely, be alone,
never feel that deadly caress; he may even recover his lost gaiety,
his lost health, once more resume his profession, once more earn fame
and money by his art.

How hard he tries to get over the distance that divides him from
Paris, while day by day he grows weaker, and his step slower and more
heavy!

But there is an end at last; the long dreary roads are passed. This is
Paris, which he enters for the first time--Paris, of which he has
dreamed so much--Paris, whose million voices are to exorcise his
phantom.

To him tonight Paris seems one vast chaos of lights, music, and
confusion--lights which dance before his eyes and will not be still---
music that rings in his ears and deafens him---confusion which makes
his head whirl round and round.

But, in spite of all, he finds the opera-house, where there is a
masked ball. He has enough money left to buy a ticket of admission,
and to hire a domino to throw over his shabby dress. It seems only a
moment after his entering the gates of Paris that he is in the very
midst of all the wild gaiety of the opera-house ball.

No more darkness, no more loneliness, but a mad crowd, shouting and
dancing, and a lovely Débardeuse hanging on his arm.

The boisterous gaiety he feels surely is his old light-heartedness
come back. He hears the people round him talking of the outrageous
conduct of some drunken student, and it is to him they point when they
say this to him, who has not moistened his lips since yesterday at
noon, for even now he will not drink; though his lips are parched, and
his throat burning, he cannot drink.

His voice is thick and hoarse, and his utterance indistinct; but still
this must be his old light-heartedness come back that makes him so
wildly gay.

The little Débardeuse is wearied out--her arm rests on his shoulder
heavier than lead--the other dancers one by one drop off.

The lights in the chandeliers one by one die out.

The decorations look pale and shadowy in that dim light which is
neither night nor day.

A faint glimmer from the dying lamps, a pale streak of cold grey light
from the new-born day, creeping in through half-opened shutters.

And by this light the bright-eyed Débardeuse fades sadly. He looks her
in the face. How the brightness of her eyes dies out! Again he looks
her in the face. How white that face has grown!

Again--and now it is the shadow of a face alone that looks in his.

Again--and they are gone--the bright eyes, the face, the shadow of the
face. He is alone; alone in that vast saloon.

Alone, and, in the terrible silence, he hears the echoes of his own
footsteps in that dismal dance which has no music.

No music but the beating of his breast. For the cold arms are round
his neck--they whirl him round, they will not be flung off, or cast
away; he can no more escape from their icy grasp than he can escape
from death. He looks behind him--there is nothing but himself in the
great empty salle; but he can feel--cold, deathlike, but O, how
palpable!--the long slender fingers, and the ring which was his
mother's.

He tries to shout, but he has no power in his burning throat. The
silence of the place is only broken by the echoes of his own footsteps
in the dance from which he cannot extricate himself.

Who says he has no partner? The cold hands are clasped on his breast,
and now he does not shun their caress. No! One more polka, if he drops
down dead.

The lights are all out, and, half an hour after, the gendarmes come in
with a lantern to see that the house is empty; they are followed by a
great dog that they have found seated howling on the steps of the
theatre. Near the principal entrance they stumble over---The body of a
student, who has died from want of food, exhaustion, and the breaking
of a blood-vessel.



THE SHADOW IN THE CORNER

Wildheath Grange stood a little way back from the road, with a barren
stretch of heath behind it, and a few tall fir-trees, with straggling
wind-tossed heads, for its only shelter. It was a lonely house on a
lonely road, little better than a lane, leading across a desolate
waste of sandy fields to the sea-shore; and it was a house that bore a
bad name among the natives of the village of Holcroft, which was the
nearest place where humanity might be found.

It was a good old house, nevertheless, substantially built in the days
when there was no stint of stone and timber--a good old grey stone
house with many gables, deep window-seats, and a wide staircase, long
dark passages, hidden doors in queer corners, closets as large as some
modern rooms, and cellars in which a company of soldiers might have
lain perdu.

This spacious old mansion was given over to rats and mice, loneliness,
echoes, and the occupation of three elderly people: Michael Bascom,
whose forebears had been landowners of importance in the
neighbourhood, and his two servants, Daniel Skegg and his wife, who
had served the owner of that grim old house ever since he left the
university, where he had lived fifteen years of his life--five as
student, and ten as professor of natural science.

At three-and-thirty Michael Bascom had seemed a middle-aged man; at
fifty-six he looked and moved and spoke like an old man. During that
interval of twenty-three years he had lived alone in Wildheath Grange,
and the country people told each other that the house had made him
what he was. This was a fanciful and superstitious notion on their
part, doubtless, yet it would not have been difficult to have traced a
certain affinity between the dull grey building and the man who lived
in it. Both seemed alike remote from the common cares and interests of
humanity; both had an air of settled melancholy, engendered by
perpetual solitude; both had the same faded complexion, the same look
of slow decay.

Yet lonely as Michael Bascom's life was at Wildheath Grange, he would
not on any account have altered its tenor. He had been glad to
exchange the comparative seclusion of college rooms for the unbroken
solitude of Wildheath. He was a fanatic in his love of scientific
research, and his quiet days were filled to the brim with labours that
seldom failed to interest and satisfy him. There were periods of
depression, occasional moments of doubt, when the goal towards which
he strove seemed unattainable, and his spirit fainted within him.
Happily such times were rare with him. He had a dogged power of
continuity which ought to have carried him to the highest pinnacle of
achievement, and which perhaps might ultimately have won for him a
grand name and a world-wide renown, but for a catastrophe which
burdened the declining years of his harmless life with an
unconquerable remorse.

One autumn morning--when he had lived just three-and-twenty years at
Wildheath, and had only lately begun to perceive that his faithful
butler and body servant, who was middle-aged when he first employed
him, was actually getting old--Mr. Bascom's breakfast meditations over
the latest treatise on the atomic theory were interrupted by an abrupt
demand from that very Daniel Skegg. The man was accustomed to wait
upon his master in the most absolute silence, and his sudden breaking
out into speech was almost as startling as if the bust of Socrates
above the bookcase had burst into human language.

"It's no use," said Daniel; "my missus must have a girl!"

"A what?" demanded Mr. Bascom, without taking his eyes from the line
he had been reading.

"A girl--a girl to trot about and wash up, and help the old lady.
She's getting weak on her legs, poor soul. We've none of us grown
younger in the last twenty years."

"Twenty years!" echoed Michael Bascom scornfully. "What is twenty
years in the formation of a strata--what even in the growth of an
oak--the cooling of a volcano!"

"Not much, perhaps, but it's apt to tell upon the bones of a human
being."

"The manganese staining to be seen upon some skulls would certainly
indicate--" began the scientist dreamily.

"I wish my bones were only as free from rheumatics as they were twenty
years ago," pursued Daniel testily; "and then, perhaps, I should make
light of twenty years. Howsoever, the long and the short of it is, my
missus must have a girl. She can't go on trotting up and down these
everlasting passages, and standing in that stone scullery year after
year, just as if she was a young woman. She must have a girl to help."

"Let her have twenty girls," said Mr. Bascom, going back to his book.

"What's the use of talking like that, sir. Twenty girls, indeed! We
shall have rare work to get one."

"Because the neighbourhood is sparsely populated?" interrogated Mr.
Bascom, still reading.

"No, sir. Because this house is known to be haunted."

Michael Bascom laid down his book, and turned a look of grave reproach
upon his servant.

"Skegg," he said in a severe voice, "I thought you had lived long
enough with me to be superior to any folly of that kind."

"I don't say that I believe in ghosts," answered Daniel with a semi-
apologetic air; "but the country people do. There's not a mortal among
'em that will venture across our threshold after nightfall."

"Merely because Anthony Bascom, who led a wild life in London, and
lost his money and land, came home here broken-hearted, and is
supposed to have destroyed himself in this house--the only remnant of
property that was left him out of a fine estate."

"Supposed to have destroyed himself!" cried Skegg; "why the fact is as
well known as the death of Queen Elizabeth, or the great fire of
London. Why, wasn't he buried at the cross-roads between here and
Holcroft?"

"An idle tradition, for which you could produce no substantial proof,"
retorted Mr. Bascom.

"I don't know about proof; but the country people believe it as firmlyas they believe their Gospel."

"If their faith in the Gospel was a little stronger they need not
trouble themselves about Anthony Bascom."

"Well," grumbled Daniel, as he began to clear the table, "a girl of
some kind we must get, but she'll have to be a foreigner, or a girl
that's hard driven for a place."

When Daniel Skegg said a foreigner, he did not mean the native of some
distant clime, but a girl who had not been born and bred at Holcroft.
Daniel had been raised and reared in that insignificant hamlet, and,
small and dull as it was, he considered the world beyond it only
margin.

Michael Bascom was too deep in the atomic theory to give a second
thought to the necessities of an old servant. Mrs. Skegg was an
individual with whom he rarely came in contact. She lived for the most
part in a gloomy region at the north end of the house, where she ruled
over the solitude of a kitchen, that looked like a cathedral, and
numerous offices of the sculler, larder, and pantry class, where she
carried on a perpetual warfare with spiders and beetles, and wore her
old life out in the labour of sweeping and scrubbing. She was a woman
of severe aspect, dogmatic piety, and a bitter tongue. She was a good
plain cook, and ministered diligently to her master's wants. He was
not an epicure, but liked his life to be smooth and easy, and the
equilibrium of his mental power would have been disturbed by a bad
dinner.

He heard no more about the proposed addition to his household for a
space of ten days, when Daniel Skegg again startled him amidst his
studious repose by the abrupt announcement:

"I've got a girl!"

"Oh," said Michael Bascom; "have you?" and he went on with his book.

This time he was reading an essay on phosphorus and its functions in
relation to the human brain.

"Yes," pursued Daniel in his usual grumbling tone; "she was a waif and
stray, or I shouldn't have got her. If she'd been a native she'd never
have come to us."

"I hope she's respectable," said Michael.

"Respectable! That's the only fault she has, poor thing. She's too
good for the place. She's never been in service before, but she says
she's willing to work, and I daresay my old woman will be able to
break her in. Her father was a small tradesman at Yarmouth. He died a
month ago, and left this poor thing homeless. Mrs. Midge, at Holcroft,
is her aunt, and she said to the girl, Come and stay with me till you
get a place; and the girl has been staying with Mrs. Midge for the
last three weeks, trying to hear of a place. When Mrs. Midge heard
that my missus wanted a girl to help, she thought it would be the very
thing for her niece Maria. Luckily Maria had heard nothing about this
house, so the poor innocent dropped me a curtsey, and said she'd be
thankful to come, and would do her best to learn her duty. She'd had
an easy time of it with her father, who had educated her above her
station, like a fool as he was," growled Daniel.

"By your own account I'm afraid you've made a bad bargain," said
Michael. "You don't want a young lady to clean kettles and pans."

"If she was a young duchess my old woman would make her work,"
retorted Skegg decisively.

"And pray where are you going to put this girl?" asked Mr. Bascom,
rather irritably; "I can't have a strange young woman tramping up and
down the passages outside my room. You know what a wretched sleeper I
am, Skegg. A mouse behind the wainscot is enough to wake me."

"I've thought of that," answered the butler, with his look of
ineffable wisdom. "I'm not going to put her on your floor. She's to
sleep in the attics."

"Which room?"

"The big one at the north end of the house. That's the only ceiling
that doesn't let water. She might as well sleep in a shower-bath as in
any of the other attics."

"The room at the north end," repeated Mr. Bascom thoughtfully; "isn't
that--?"

"Of course it is," snapped Skegg; "but she doesn't know anything about
it."

Mr. Bascom went back to his books, and forgot all about the orphan
from Yarmouth, until one morning on entering his study he was startled
by the appearance of a strange girl, in a neat black and white cotton
gown, busy dusting the volumes which were stacked in blocks upon his
spacious writing-table--and doing it with such deft and careful hands
that he had no inclination to be angry at this unwonted liberty. Old
Mrs. Skegg had religiously refrained from all such dusting, on the
plea that she did not wish to interfere with the master's ways. One of
the master's ways, therefore, had been to inhale a good deal of dust
in the course of his studies.

The girl was a slim little thing, with a pale and somewhat old-
fashioned face, flaxen hair, braided under a neat muslin cap, a very
fair complexion, and light blue eyes. They were the lightest blue eyes
Michael Bascom had ever seen, but there was a sweetness and gentleness
in their expression which atoned for their insipid colour.

"I hope you do not object to my dusting your books, sir," she said,
dropping a curtsey.

She spoke with a quaint precision which struck Michael Bascom as a
pretty thing in its way.

"No; I don't object to cleanliness, so long as my books and papers are
not disturbed. If you take a volume off my desk, replace it on the
spot you took it from. That's all I ask."

"I will be very careful, sir."

"When did you come here?"

"Only this morning, sir."

The student seated himself at his desk, and the girl withdrew,
drifting out of the room as noiselessly as a flower blown across the
threshold. Michael Bascom looked after her curiously. He had seen very
little of youthful womanhood in his dry-as-dust career, and he
wondered at this girl as at a creature of a species hitherto unknown
to him. How fairly and delicately she was fashioned; what a
translucent skin; what soft and pleasing accents issued from those
rose-tinted lips. A pretty thing, assuredly, this kitchen wench! A pity
that in all this busy world there could be no better work found for
her than the scouring of pots and pans.

Absorbed in considerations about dry bones, Mr. Bascom thought no more
of the pale-faced handmaiden. He saw her no more about his rooms.
Whatever work she did there was done early in the morning, before the
scholar's breakfast.

She had been a week in the house, when he met her one day in the hall.
He was struck by the change in her appearance.

The girlish lips had lost their rose-bud hue; the pale blue eyes had a
frightened look, and there were dark rings round them, as in one whose
nights had been sleepless, or troubled by evil dreams.

Michael Bascom was so startled by an undefinable look in the girl's
face that, reserved as he was by habit and nature, he expanded so far
as to ask her what ailed her.

"There is something amiss, I am sure," he said. "What is it?"

"Nothing, sir," she faltered, looking still more scared at his
question. "Indeed, it is nothing; or nothing worth troubling you
about."

"Nonsense. Do you suppose, because I live among books, I have no
sympathy with my fellow-creatures? Tell me what is wrong with you,
child. You have been grieving about the father you have lately lost, I
suppose."

"No, sir; it is not that. I shall never leave off being sorry for
that. It is a grief which will last me all my life."

"What, there is something else then?" asked Michael impatiently. "I
see; you are not happy here. Hard work does not suit you. I thought as
much."

"Oh, sir, please don't think that," cried the girl, very earnestly.
"Indeed, I am glad to work--glad to be in service; it is only--"

She faltered and broke down, the tears rolling slowly from her
sorrowful eyes, despite her effort to keep them back.

"Only what?" cried Michael, growing angry. "The girl is full of
secrets and mysteries. What do you mean, wench?"

"I--I know it is very foolish, sir; but I am afraid of the room where
I sleep."

"Afraid! Why?"

"Shall I tell you the truth, sir? Will you promise not to be angry?"

"I will not be angry if you will only speak plainly; but you provoke
me by these hesitations and suppressions."

"And please, sir, do not tell Mrs. Skegg that I have told you. She
would scold me; or perhaps even send me away."

"Mrs. Skegg shall not scold you. Go on, child."

"You may not know the room where I sleep, sir; it is a large room at
one end of the house, looking towards the sea. I can see the dark line
of water from the window, and I wonder sometimes to think that it is
the same ocean I used to see when I was a child at Yarmouth. It is
very lonely, sir, at the top of the house. Mr. and Mrs. Skegg sleep in
a little room near the kitchen, you know, sir, and I am quite alone on
the top floor."

"Skegg told me you had been educated in advance of your position in
life, Maria. I should have thought the first effect of a good
education would have been to make you superior to any foolish fancies
about empty rooms."

"Oh, pray, sir, do not think it is any fault in my education. Father
took such pains with me; he spared no expense in giving me as good an
education as a tradesman's daughter need wish for. And he was a
religious man, sir. He did not believe"--here she paused, with a
suppressed shudder--"in the spirits of the dead appearing to the
living, since the days of miracles, when the ghost of Samuel appeared
to Saul. He never put any foolish ideas into my head, sir. I hadn't a
thought of fear when I first lay down to rest in the big lonely room
upstairs."

"Well, what then?"

"But on the very first night," the girl went on breathlessly, "I felt
weighed down in my sleep as if there were some heavy burden laid upon
my chest. It was not a bad dream, but it was a sense of trouble that
followed me all through my sleep; and just at daybreak--it begins to
be light a little after six--I woke suddenly, with the cold
perspiration pouring down my face, and knew that there was something
dreadful in the room."

"What do you mean by something dreadful. Did you see anything?"

"Not much, sir; but it froze the blood in my veins, and I knew it was
this that had been following me and weighing upon me all through my
sleep. In the corner, between the fire-place and the wardrobe, I saw a
shadow--a dim, shapeless shadow--"

"Produced by an angle of the wardrobe, I daresay."

"No, sir; I could see the shadow of the wardrobe, distinct and sharp,
as if it had been painted on the wall. This shadow was in the corner--
a strange, shapeless mass; or, if it had any shape at all, it seemed--
"

"What?" asked Michael eagerly.

"The shape of a dead body hanging against the wall!"

Michael Bascom grew strangely pale, yet he affected utter incredulity.

"Poor child," he said kindly; "you have been fretting about your
father until your nerves are in a weak state, and you are full of
fancies. A shadow in the corner, indeed; why, at daybreak, every
corner is full of shadows. My old coat, flung upon a chair, will make
you as good a ghost as you need care to see."

"Oh, sir, I have tried to think it is my fancy. But I have had the
same burden weighing me down every night. I have seen the same shadow
every morning."

"But when broad daylight comes, can you not see what stuff your shadow
is made of?"

"No, sir: the shadow goes before it is broad daylight."

"Of course, just like other shadows. Come, come, get these silly
notions out of your head, or you will never do for the work-a-day
world. I could easily speak to Mrs. Skegg, and make her give you
another room, if I wanted to encourage you in your folly. But that
would be about the worst thing I could do for you. Besides, she tells
me that all the other rooms on that floor are damp; and, no doubt, if
she shifted you into one of them, you would discover another shadow in
another corner, and get rheumatism into the bargain. No, my good girl,
you must try to prove yourself the better for a superior education."

"I will do my best, sir," Maria answered meekly, dropping a curtsey.

Maria went back to the kitchen sorely depressed. It was a dreary life
she led at Wildheath Grange--dreary by day, awful by night; for the
vague burden and the shapeless shadow, which seemed so slight a matter
to the elderly scholar, were unspeakably terrible to her. Nobody had
told her that the house was haunted, yet she walked about those
echoing passages wrapped round with a cloud of fear. She had no pity
from Daniel Skegg and his wife. Those two pious souls had made up
their minds that the character of the house should be upheld, so far
as Maria went. To her, as a foreigner, the Grange should be maintained
to be an immaculate dwelling, tainted by no sulphurous blast from the
under world. A willing, biddable girl had become a necessary element
in the existence of Mrs. Skegg. That girl had been found, and that
girl must be kept. Any fancies of a supernatural character must be put
down with a high hand.

"Ghosts, indeed!" cried the amiable Skegg. "Read your Bible, Maria,
and don't talk no more about ghosts."

"There are ghosts in the Bible," said Maria, with a shiver at the
recollection of certain awful passages in the Scripture she knew so
well.

"Ah, they was in their right place, or they wouldn't ha' been there,"
retorted Mrs. Skegg. "You ain't agoin' to pick holes in your Bible, I
hope, Maria, at your time of life."

Maria sat down quietly in her corner by the kitchen fire, and turned
over the leaves of her dead father's Bible till she came to the
chapters they two had loved best and oftenest read together. He had
been a simple-minded, straightforward man, the Yarmouth cabinet-
maker--a man full of aspirations after good, innately refined,
instinctively religious. He and his motherless girl had spent their
lives alone together, in the neat little home which Maria had so soon
learnt to cherish and beautify; and they had loved each other with an
almost romantic love. They had had the same tastes, the same ideas.
Very little had sufficed to make them happy. But inexorable death
parted father and daughter, in one of those sharp, sudden partings
which are like the shock of an earthquake--instantaneous ruin,
desolation, and despair.

Maria's fragile form had bent before the tempest. She had lived
through a trouble that might have crushed a stronger nature. Her deep
religious convictions, and her belief that this cruel parting would
not be for ever, had sustained her. She faced life, and its cares and
duties, with a gentle patience which was the noblest form of courage.

Michael Bascom told himself that the servant-girl's foolish fancy
about the room that had been given her was not a matter of serious
consideration. Yet the idea dwelt in his mind unpleasantly, and
disturbed him at his labours. The exact sciences require the complete
power of a man's brain, his utmost attention; and on this particular
evening Michael found that he was only giving his work a part of his
attention. The girl's pale face, the girl's tremulous tones, thrust
themselves into the foreground of his thoughts.

He closed his book with a fretful sigh, wheeled his large arm-chair
round to the fire, and gave himself up to contemplation. To attempt
study with so disturbed a mind was useless. It was a dull grey
evening, early in November; the student's reading-lamp was lighted,
but the shutters were not yet shut, nor the curtains drawn. He could
see the leaden sky outside his windows, the fir-tree tops tossing in
the angry wind. He could hear the wintry blast whistling amidst the
gables, before it rushed off seaward with a savage howl that sounded
like a war-whoop.

Michael Bascom shivered, and drew nearer the fire.

"It's childish, foolish nonsense," he said to himself, "yet it's
strange she should have that fancy about the shadow, for they say
Anthony Bascom destroyed himself in that room. I remember hearing it
when I was a boy, from an old servant whose mother was housekeeper at
the great house in Anthony's time. I never heard how he died, poor
fellow--whether he poisoned himself, or shot himself, or cut his
throat; but I've been told that was the room. Old Skegg has heard it
too. I could see that by his manner when he told me the girl was to
sleep there."

He sat for a long time, till the grey of evening outside his study
windows changed to the black of night, and the war-whoop of the wind
died away to a low complaining murmur. He sat looking into the fire,
and letting his thoughts wander back to the past and the traditions he
had heard in his boyhood.

That was a sad, foolish story of his great-uncle, Anthony Bascom: the
pitiful story of a wasted fortune and a wasted life. A riotous
collegiate career at Cambridge, a racing-stable at Newmarket, an
imprudent marriage, a dissipated life in London, a runaway wife; an
estate forfeited to Jew money-lenders, and then the fatal end.

Michael had often heard that dismal story: how, when Anthony Bascom's
fair false wife had left him, when his credit was exhausted, and his
friends had grown tired of him, and all was gone except Wildheath
Grange, Anthony, the broken-down man of fashion, had come to that
lonely house unexpectedly one night, and had ordered his bed to be got
ready for him in the room where he used to sleep when he came to the
place for the wild duck shooting, in his boyhood. His old blunderbuss
was still hanging over the mantelpiece, where he had left it when he
came into the property, and could afford to buy the newest thing in
fowling-pieces. He had not been to Wildheath for fifteen years; nay,
for a good many of those years he had almost forgotten that the drear;
old house belonged to him.

The woman who had been housekeeper at Bascom Park, till house and
lands had passed into the hands of the Jews, was at this time the sole
occupant of Wildheath. She cooked some supper tor her master, and made
him as comfortable as she could in the long untenanted dining-room;
but she was distressed to find, when she cleared the table after he
had gone upstairs to bed, that he had eaten hardly anything.

Next morning she got his breakfast ready in the same room, which she
managed to make brighter and cheerier than it had looked overnight.
Brooms, dusting-brushes, and a good fire did much to improve the
aspect of things. But the morning wore on to noon, and the old
housekeeper listened in vain for her master's footfall on the stairs.
Noon waned to late afternoon. She had made no attempt to disturb him,
thinking that he had worn himself out by a tedious journey on
horseback, and that he was sleeping the sleep of exhaustion. But when
the brief November day clouded with the first shadows of twilight, the
old woman grew seriously alarmed, and went upstairs to her master's
door, where she waited in vain for any reply to her repeated calls and
knockings.

The door was locked on the inside, and the housekeeper was not strong
enough to break it open. She rushed downstairs again full of fear, and
ran bare-headed out into the lonely road. There was no habitation
nearer than the turnpike on the old coach road, from which this side
road branched off to the sea. There was scanty hope of a chance
passer-by. The old woman ran along the road, hardly knowing whither
she was going or what she was going to do, but with a vague idea that
she must get somebody to help her.

Chance favoured her. A cart, laden with sea-weed, came lumbering
slowly along from the level line of sands yonder where the land melted
into water. A heavy lumbering farm-labourer walked beside the cart.

"For God's sake, come in and burst open my master's door!" she
entreated, seizing the man by the arm. "He's lying dead, or in a fit,
and I can't get to help him."

"All right, missus," answered the man, as if such an invitation were a
matter of daily occurrence. "Whoa, Dobbin; stond still, horse, and be
donged to thee."

Dobbin was glad enough to be brought to anchor on the patch of waste
grass in front of the Grange garden. His master followed the
housekeeper upstairs, and shattered the old-fashioned box-lock with
one blow of his ponderous fist.

The old woman's worst fear was realised. Anthony Bascom was dead. But
the mode and manner of his death Michael had never been able to learn.
The housekeeper's daughter, who told him the story, was an old woman
when he was a boy. She had only shaken her head, and looked
unutterable things, when he questioned her too closely. She had never
even admitted that the old squire had committed suicide. Yet the
tradition of his self-destruction was rooted in the minds of the
natives of Holcroft: and there was a settled belief that his ghost, at
certain times and seasons, haunted Wildheath Grange.

Now Michael Bascom was a stern materialist. For him the universe with
all its inhabitants, was a great machine, governed by inexorable laws.
To such a man the idea of a ghost was simply absurd--as absurd as the
assertion that two and two make five, or that a circle can be formed
of a straight line. Yet he had a kind of dilettante interest in the
idea of a mind which could believe in ghosts. The subject offered an
amusing psychological study. This poor little pale girl, now, had
evidently got some supernatural terror into her head, which could only
be conquered by rational treatment.

"I know what I ought to do," Michael Bascom said to himself suddenly.
"I'll occupy that room myself tonight, and demonstrate to this foolish
girl that her notion about the shadow is nothing more than a silly
fancy, bred of timidity and low spirits. An ounce of proof is better
than a pound of argument. If I can prove to her that I have spent a
night in the room, and seen no such shadow, she will understand what
an idle thing superstition is."

Daniel came in presently to shut the shutters.

"Tell your wife to make up my bed in the room where Maria has been
sleeping, and to put her into one of the rooms on the first floor for
to-night, Skegg," said Mr. Bascom.

"Sir?"

Mr. Bascom repeated his order.

"That silly wench has been complaining to you about her room," Skegg
exclaimed indignantly. "She doesn't deserve to be well fed and cared
for in a comfortable home. She ought to go to the workhouse."

"Don't be angry with the poor girl, Skegg. She has taken a foolish
fancy into her head, and I want to show her how silly she is," said
Mr. Bascom.

"And you want to sleep in his--in that room yourself," said the
butler.

"Precisely."

"Well," mused Skegg, "if he does walk--which I don't believe--he was
your own flesh and blood; and I don't suppose he'll do you any hurt."

When Daniel Skegg went back to the kitchen he railed mercilessly at
poor Maria, who sat pale and silent in her corner by the hearth,
darning old Mrs. Skegg's grey worsted stockings, which were the
roughest and harshest armour that ever human foot clothed itself
withal. "Was there ever such a whimsical, fine, lady-like miss,"
demanded Daniel, "to come into a gentleman's house, and drive him out
of his own bedroom to sleep in an attic, with her nonsenses and
vagaries." If this was the result of being educated above one's
station, Daniel declared that he was thankful he had never got so far
in his schooling as to read words of two syllables without spelling.
Education might be hanged for him, if this was all it led to.

"I am very sorry," faltered Maria, weeping silently over her work.
"Indeed, Mr. Skegg, I made no complaint. My master questioned me, and
I told him the truth. That was all."

"All!" exclaimed Mr. Skegg irately; "all, indeed! I should think it
was enough."

Poor Maria held her peace. Her mind, fluttered by Daniel's unkindness,
had wandered away from that bleak big kitchen to the lost home of the
past--the snug little parlour where she and her father had sat beside
the cosy hearth on such a night as this; she with her smart work-box
and her plain sewing, he with the newspaper he loved to read; the
petted cat purring on the rug, the kettle singing on the bright brass
trivet, the tea-tray pleasantly suggestive of the most comfortable
meal in the day.

Oh, those happy nights, that dear companionship! Were they really gone
for ever, leaving nothing behind them but unkindness and servitude?

Michael Bascom retired later than usual that night. He was in the
habit of sitting at his books long after every other lamp but his own
had been extinguished. The Skeggs had subsided into silence and
darkness in their drear ground-floor bed-chamber. Tonight his studies
were of a peculiarly interesting kind, and belonged to the order of
recreative reading rather than of hard work. He was deep in the
history of that mysterious people who had their dwelling-place in the
Swiss lakes, and was much exercised by certain speculations and
theories about them.

The old eight-day clock on the stairs was striking two as Michael
slowly ascended, candle in hand, to the hitherto unknown region of the
attics. At the top of the staircase he found himself facing a dark
narrow passage which led northwards, a passage that was in itself
sufficient to strike terror to a superstitious mind, so black and
uncanny did it look.

"Poor child," mused Mr. Bascom, thinking of Maria; "this attic floor
is rather dreary, and for a young mind prone to fancies--"

He had opened the door of the north room by this time, and stood
looking about him.

It was a large room, with a ceiling that sloped on one side, but was
fairly lofty upon the other; an old-fashioned room, full of old-
fashioned furniture--big, ponderous, clumsy--associated with a day
that was gone and people that were dead. A walnut-wood wardrobe stared
him in the face--a wardrobe with brass handles, which gleamed out of
the darkness like diabolical eyes. There was a tall four-post
bedstead, which had been cut down on one side to accommodate the slope
of the ceiling, and which had a misshapen and deformed aspect in
consequence. There was an old mahogany bureau, that smelt of secrets.
There were some heavy old chairs with rush bottoms, mouldy with age,
and much worn. There was a corner washstand, with a big basin and a
small jug--the odds and ends of past years. Carpet there was none,
save a narrow strip beside the bed.

"It is a dismal room," mused Michael, with the same touch of pity for
Maria's weakness which he had felt on the landing just now.

To him it mattered nothing where he slept; but having let himself down
to a lower level by his interest in the Swiss lake-people, he was in a
manner humanised by the lightness of his evening's reading, and was
even inclined to compassionate the weaknesses of a foolish girl.

He went to bed, determined to sleep his soundest. The bed was
comfortable, well supplied with blankets, rather luxurious than
otherwise, and the scholar had that agreeable sense of fatigue which
promises profound and restful slumber.

He dropped off to sleep quickly, but woke with a start ten minutes
afterwards. What was this consciousness of a burden of care that had
awakened him--this sense of all-pervading trouble that weighed upon
his spirits and oppressed his heart--this icy horror of some terrible
crisis in life through which he must inevitably pass? To him these
feelings were as novel as they were painful. His life had flowed on
with smooth and sluggish tide, unbroken by so much as a ripple of
sorrow. Yet to-night he felt all the pangs of unavailing remorse; the
agonising memory of a life wasted; the stings of humiliation and
disgrace, shame, ruin; a hideous death, which he had doomed himself to
die by his own hand. These were the horrors that pressed him round and
weighed him down as he lay in Anthony Bascom's room.

Yes, even he, the man who could recognise nothing in nature, or in
nature's God, better or higher than an irresponsible and invariable
machine governed by mechanical laws, was fain to admit that here he
found himself face to face with a psychological mystery. This trouble,
which came between him and sleep, was the trouble that had pursued
Anthony Bascom on the last night of his life. So had the suicide felt
as he lay in that lonely room, perhaps striving to rest his wearied
brain with one last earthly sleep before he passed to the unknown
intermediate land where all is darkness and slumber. And that troubled
mind had haunted the room ever since. It was not the ghost of the
man's body that returned to the spot where he had suffered and
perished, but the ghost of his mind--his very self; no meaningless
simulacrum of the clothes he were, and the figure that filled them.

Michael Bascom was not the man to abandon his high ground of sceptical
philosophy without a struggle. He tried his hardest to conquer this
oppression that weighed upon mind and sense. Again and again he
succeeded in composing himself to sleep, but only to wake again and
again to the same torturing thoughts, the same remorse, the same
despair. So the night passed in unutterable weariness; for though he
told himself that the trouble was not his trouble, that there was no
reality in the burden, no reason for the remorse, these vivid fancies
were as painful as realities, and took as strong a hold upon him.

The first streak of light crept in at the window--dim, and cold, and
grey; then came twilight, and he looked at the corner between the
wardrobe and the door.

Yes; there was the shadow: not the shadow of the wardrobe only--that
was clear enough, but a vague and shapeless something which darkened
the dull brown wall; so faint, so shadow, that he could form no
conjecture as to its nature, or the thing it represented. He
determined to watch this shadow till broad daylight; but the weariness
of the night had exhausted him, and before the first dimness of dawn
had passed away he had fallen fast asleep, and was tasting the blessed
balm of undisturbed slumber. When he woke the winter sun was shining
in at the lattice, and the room had lost its gloomy aspect. It looked
old-fashioned, and grey, and brown, and shabby; but the depth of its
gloom had fled with the shadows and the darkness of night.

Mr. Bascom rose refreshed by a sound sleep, which had lasted nearly
three hours. He remembered the wretched feelings which had gone before
that renovating slumber; but he recalled his strange sensations only
to despise them, and he despised himself for having attached any
importance to them.

"Indigestion very likely," he told himself; "or perhaps mere fancy,
engendered of that foolish girl's story. The wisest of us is more
under the dominion of imagination than he would care to confess. Well,
Maria shall not sleep in this room any more. There is no particular
reason why she should, and she shall not be made unhappy to please old
Skegg and his wife."

When he had dressed himself in his usual leisurely way, Mr. Bascom
walked up to the corner where he had seen or imagined the shadow, and
examined the spot carefully.

At first sight he could discover nothing of a mysterious character.
There was no door in the papered wall, no trace of a door that had
been there in the past. There was no trap-door in the worm-eaten
boards. There was no dark ineradicable stain to hint at murder. There
was not the faintest suggestion of a secret or a mystery.

He looked up at the ceiling. That was sound enough, save for a dirty
patch here and there where the rain had blistered it.

Yes; there was something--an insignificant thing, yet with a
suggestion of grimness which startled him.

About a foot below the ceiling he saw a large iron hook projecting
from the wall, just above the spot where he had seen the shadow of a
vaguely defined form. He mounted on a chair the better to examine this
hook, and to understand, if he could, the purpose for which it had
been put there.

It was old and rusty. It must have been there for many years. Who
could have placed it there, and why? It was not the kind of hook upon
which one would hang a picture or one's garments. It was placed in an
obscure corner. Had Anthony Bascom put it there on the night he died;
or did he find it there ready for a fatal use?

"If I were a superstitious man," thought Michael, "I should be
inclined to believe that Anthony Bascom hung himself from that rusty
old hook."

"Sleep well, sir?" asked Daniel, as he waited upon his master at
breakfast.

"Admirably," answered Michael, determined not to gratify the man's
curiosity.

He had always resented the idea that Wildheath Grange was haunted.

"Oh, indeed, sir. You were so late that I fancied--"

"Late, yes! I slept so well that I overshot my usual hour for waking.
But, by-the-way, Skegg, as that poor girl objects to the room, let her
sleep somewhere else. It can't make any difference to us, and it may
make some difference to her."

"Humph!" muttered Daniel in his grumpy way; "you didn't see anything
queer up there, did you?"

"See anything? Of course not."

"Well, then, why should she see things? It's all her silly fiddle-
faddle."

"Never mind, let her sleep in another room."

"There ain't another room on the top floor that's dry."

"Then let her sleep on the floor below. She creeps about quietly
enough, poor little timid thing. She won't disturb me."

Daniel grunted, and his master understood the grunt to mean obedient
assent; but here Mr. Bascom was unhappily mistaken. The proverbial
obstinacy of the pig family is as nothing compared with the obstinacy
of a cross-grained old man, whose narrow mind has never been
illuminated by education. Daniel was beginning to feel jealous of his
master's compassionate interest in the orphan girl. She was a sort of
gentle clinging thing that might creep into an elderly bachelor's
heart unawares, and make herself a comfortable nest there.

"We shall have fine carryings-on, and me and my old woman will be
nowhere, if I don't put down my heel pretty strong upon this
nonsense," Daniel muttered to himself, as he carried the breakfast-
tray to the pantry.

Maria met him in the passage.

"Well, Mr. Skegg, what did my master say?" she asked breathlessly."Did he see anything strange in the room?"

"No, girl. What should he see? He said you were a fool."

"Nothing disturbed him? And he slept there peacefully?" faltered
Maria.

"Never slept better in his life. Now don't you begin to feel ashamed
of yourself?"

"Yes," she answered meekly; "I am ashamed of being so full of fancies.
I will go back to my room tonight, Mr. Skegg, if you like, and I will
never complain of it again."

"I hope you won't," snapped Skegg; "you've given us trouble enough
already."

Maria sighed, and went about her work in saddest silence. The day wore
slowly on, like all other days in that lifeless old house. The scholar
sat in his study; Maria moved softly from room to room, sweeping and
dusting in the cheerless solitude. The mid-day sun faded into the grey
of afternoon, and evening came down like a blight upon the dull old
house.

Throughout that day Maria and her master never met. Anyone who had
been so far interested in the girl as to observe her appearance would
have seen that she was unusually pale, and that her eyes had a
resolute look, as of one who was resolved to face a painful ordeal.
She ate hardly anything all day. She was curiously silent. Skegg and
his wife put down both these symptoms to temper.

"She won't eat and she won't talk," said Daniel to the partner of his
joys. "That means sulkiness, and I never allowed sulkiness to master
me when I was a young man, and you tried it on as a young woman, and
I'm not going to be conquered by sulkiness in my old age."

Bed-time came, and Maria bade the Skeggs a civil good-night, and went
up to her lonely garret without a murmur.

The next morning came, and Mrs. Skegg looked in vain for her patient
hand-maiden, when she wanted Maria's services in preparing the
breakfast.

"The wench sleeps sound enough this morning," said the old woman. "Go
and call her, Daniel. My poor legs can't stand them stairs."

"Your poor legs are getting uncommon useless," muttered Daniel
testily, as he went to do his wife's behest.

He knocked at the door, and called Maria--once, twice, thrice, many
times; but there was no reply. He tried the door, and found it locked.
He shook the door violently, cold with fear.

Then he told himself that the girl had played him a trick. She had
stolen away before daybreak, and left the door locked to frighten him.
But, no; this could not be, for he could see the key in the lock when
he knelt down and put his eye to the keyhole. The key prevented his
seeing into the room.

"She's in there, laughing in her sleeve at me," he told himself; "but
I'll soon be even with her."

There was a heavy bar on the staircase, which was intended to secure
the shutters of the window that lighted the stairs. It was a detached
bar, and always stood in a corner near the window, which it was but
rarely employed to fasten. Daniel ran down to the landing, and seized
upon this massive iron bar, and then ran back to the garret door.

One blow from the heavy bar shattered the old lock, which was the same
lock the carter had broken with his strong fist seventy years before.
The door flew open, and Daniel went into the attic which he had chosen
for the stranger's bed-chamber.

Maria was hanging from the hook in the wall. She had contrived to
cover her face decently with her handkerchief. She had hanged herself
deliberately about an hour before Daniel found her, in the early grey
of morning. The doctor, who was summoned from Holcroft, was able to
declare the time at which she had slain herself, but there was no one
who could say what sudden access of terror had impelled her to the
desperate act, or under what slow torture of nervous apprehension her
mind had given way. The coroner's jury returned the customary merciful
verdict of "Temporary insanity."

The girl's melancholy fate darkened the rest of Michael Bascom's life.
He fled from Wildheath Grange as from an accursed spot, and from the
Skeggs as from the murderers of a harmless innocent girl. He ended his
days at Oxford, where he found the society of congenial minds, and the
books he loved. But the memory of Maria's sad face, and sadder death,
was his abiding sorrow. Out of that deep shadow his soul was never
lifted.



GOOD LADY DUCAYNE



Chapter I



Bella Rolleston had made up her mind that her only chance of earning
her bread and helping her mother to an occasional crust was by going
out into the great unknown world as companion to a lady. She was
willing to go to any lady rich enough to pay her a salary and so
eccentric as to wish for a hired companion. Five shillings told off
reluctantly from one of those sovereigns which were so rare with the
mother and daughter, and which melted away so quickly, five solid
shillings, had been handed to a smartly-dressed lady in an office in
Harbeck Street, W., in the hope that this very Superior Person would
find a situation and a salary for Miss Rolleston.

The Superior Person glanced at the two half-crowns as they lay on the
table where Bella's hand had placed them, to make sure they were
neither of them forms, before she wrote a description of Bella's
qualifications and requirements in a formidable-looking ledger.

'Age?' she asked curtly.

'Eighteen, last July.'

'Any accomplishments?'

'No; I am not at all accomplished. If I were I should want to be a
governess--a companion seems the lowest stage.'

'We have some highly accomplished ladies on our books as companions,
or chaperon companions.'

'Oh, I know!' babbled Bella, loquacious in her youthful candour. 'But
that is quite a different thing. Mother hasn't been able to afford a
piano since I was twelve years old, so I'm afraid I've forgotten how
to play. And I have had to help mother with her needlework, so there
hasn't been much time to study.'

'Please don't waste time upon explaining what you can't do, but kindly
tell me anything you can do,' said the Superior Person, crushingly,
with her pen poised between delicate fingers waiting to write. 'Can
you read aloud for two or three hours at a stretch? Are you active and
handy, an early riser, a good walker, sweet tempered, and obliging?'

'I can say yes to all those questions except about the sweetness. I
think I have a pretty good temper, and I should be anxious to oblige
anybody who paid for my services. I should want them to feel that I
was really earning my salary.'

'The kind of ladies who come to me would not care for a talkative
companion,' said the Person, severely, having finished writing in her
book. 'My connection lies chiefly among the aristocracy, and in that
class considerable deference is expected.'

'Oh, of course,' said Bella; 'but it's quite different when I'm
talking to you. I want to tell you all about myself once and for
ever.'

'I am glad it is to be only once!' said the Person, with the edges of
her lips.

The Person was of uncertain age, tightly laced in a black silk gown.
She had a powdery complexion and a handsome clump of somebody else's
hair on the top of her head. It may be that Bella's girlish freshness
and vivacity had an irritating effect upon nerves weakened by an eight
hours day in that over-heated second floor in Harbeck Street. To Bella
the official apartment, with its Brussels carpet, velvet curtains and
velvet chairs, and French clock, ticking loud on the marble chimney-
piece, suggested the luxury of a palace, as compared with another
second floor in Walworth where Mrs Rolleston and her daughter had
managed to exist for the last six years.

'Do you think you have anything on your books that would suit me?'
faltered Bella, after a pause.

'Oh, dear, no; I have nothing in view at present,' answered the
Person, who had swept Bella's half-crowns into a drawer,
absentmindedly, with the tips of her fingers. 'You see, you are so
very unformed--so much too young to be companion to a lady of
position. It is a pity you have not enough education for a nursery
governess; that would be more in your line.'

'And do you think it will be very long before you can get me a
situation?' asked Bella, doubtfully.

'I really cannot say. Have you any particular reason for being so
impatient--not a love affair, I hope?'

'A love affair!' cried Bella, with flaming cheeks. 'What utter
nonsense. I want a situation because mother is poor, and I hate being
a burden to her. I want a salary that I can share with her.'

'There won't be much margin for sharing in the salary you are likely
to get at your age--and with your--very--unformed manners,' said the
Person, who found Bella's peony cheeks, bright eyes, and unbridled
vivacity more and more oppressive.

'Perhaps if you'd be kind enough to give me back the fee I could take
it to an agency where the connection isn't quite so aristocratic,'
said Bella, who--as she told her mother in her recital of the
interview--was determined not to be sat upon.

'You will find no agency that can do more for you than mine,' replied
the Person, whose harpy fingers never relinquished coin. 'You will
have to wait for your opportunity. Yours is an exceptional case: but I
will bear you in mind, and if anything suitable offers I will write to
you. I cannot say more than that.'

The half-contemptuous bend of the stately head, weighted with borrowed
hair, indicated the end of the interview. Bella went back to
Walworth--tramped sturdily every inch of the way in the September
afternoon--and 'took off' the Superior Person for the amusement of her
mother and the landlady, who lingered in the shabby little sitting-
room after bringing in the tea-tray, to applaud Miss Rolleston's
'taking off'.

'Dear, dear, what a mimic she is!' said the landlady. 'You ought to
have let her go on the stage, mum. She might have made her fortune as
a hactress.'



Chapter II



Bella waited and hoped, and listened for the postman's knocks which
brought such store of letters for the parlours and the first floor,
and so few for that humble second floor, where mother and daughter sat
sewing with hand and with wheel and treadle, for the greater part of
the day.

Mrs Rolleston was a lady by birth and education; but it had been her
bad fortune to marry a scoundrel; for the last half-dozen years she
had been that worst of widows, a wife whose husband had deserted her.
Happily, she was courageous, industrious, and a clever needle-woman;
and she had been able just to earn a living for herself and her only
child, by making mantles and cloaks for a West-end house. It was not a
luxurious living. Cheap lodgings in a shabby street off the Walworth
Road, scanty dinners, homely food, well-worn raiment, had been the
portion of mother and daughter; but they loved each other so dearly,
and Nature had made them both so light-hearted, that they had
contrived somehow to be happy..But now this idea of going out into the
world as companion to some fine lady had rooted itself into Bella's
mind, and although she idolized her mother, and although the parting
of mother and daughter must needs tear two loving hearts into shreds,
the girl longed for enterprise and change and excitement, as the pages
of old longed to be knights, and to start for the Holy Land to break a
lance with the infidel.

She grew tired of racing downstairs every time the postman knocked,
only to be told 'nothing for you, miss,' by the smudgy-faced drudge
who picked up the letters from the passage floor.

'Nothing for you, miss,' grinned the lodging-house drudge, till at
last Bella took heart of grace and walked up to Harbeck Street, and
asked the Superior Person how it was that no situation had been found
for her.

'You are too young,' said the Person, 'and you want a salary.'

'Of course I do,' answered Bella; 'don't other people want salaries?'

'Young ladies of your age generally want a comfortable home.

'I don't,' snapped Bella; 'I want to help mother.'

'You can call again this day week,' said the Person; 'or, if I hear of
anything in the meantime, I will write to you.

No letter came from the Person, and in exactly a week Bella put on her
neatest hat, the one that had been seldomest caught in the rain, and
trudged off to Harbeck Street.

It was a dull October afternoon, and there was a greyness in the air
which might turn to fog before night. The Walworth Road shops gleamed
brightly through that grey atmosphere, and though to a young lady
reared in Mayfair or Belgravia such shop-windows would have been
unworthy of a glance, they were a snare and temptation for Bella.
There were so many things that she longed for, and would never be able
to buy.

Harbeck Street is apt to be empty at this dead season of the year, a
long, long street, an endless perspective of eminently respectable
houses. The Person's office was at the further end, and Bella looked
down that long, grey vista almost despairingly, more tired than usual
with the trudge from Walworth. As she looked, a carriage passed her,
an old-fashioned, yellow chariot, on cee springs, drawn by a pair of
high grey horses, with the stateliest of coachmen driving them, and a
tall footman sitting by his side.

'It looks like the fairy god-mother's coach,' thought Bella. 'I
shouldn't wonder if it began by being a pumpkin.'

It was a surprise when she reached the Person's door to find the
yellow chariot standing before it, and the tall footman waiting near
the doorstep. She was almost afraid to go in and meet the owner of
that splendid carriage. She had caught only a glimpse of its occupant
as the chariot rolled by, a plumed bonnet, a patch of ermine.

The Person's smart page ushered her upstairs and knocked at the
official door. 'Miss Rolleston,' he announced, apologetically, while
Bella waited outside.

'Show her in,' said the Person, quickly; and then Bella heard her
murmuring something in a low voice to her client.

Bella went in fresh, blooming, a living image of youth and hope, and
before she looked at the Person her gaze was riveted by the owner of
the chariot.

Never had she seen anyone as old as the old lady sitting by the
Person's fire: a little old figure, wrapped from chin to feet in an
ermine mantle; a withered, old face under a plumed bonnet--a face so
wasted by age that it seemed only a pair of eyes and a peaked chin.
The nose was peaked, too, but between the sharply pointed chin and the
great, shining eyes, the small, aquiline nose was hardly
visible. 'This is Miss Rolleston, Lady Ducayne.'

Claw-like fingers, flashing with jewels, lifted a double eyeglass to
Lady Ducayne's shining black eyes, and through the glasses Bella saw
those unnaturally bright eyes magnified to a gigantic size, and
glaring at her awfully.

'Miss Torpinter has told me all about you,' said the old voice that
belonged to the eyes. 'Have you good health? Are you strong and
active, able to eat well, sleep well, walk well, able to enjoy all
that there is good in life?'

'I have never known what it is to be ill, or idle,' answered Bella.

'Then I think you will do for me.'

'Of course, in the event of references being perfectly satisfactory,'
put in the Person.

'I don't want references. The young woman looks frank and innocent.
I'll take her on trust.'

'So like you, dear Lady Ducayne,' murmured Miss Torpinter.

'I want a strong young woman whose health will give me no trouble.'

'You have been so unfortunate in that respect,' cooed the Person,
whose voice and manner were subdued to a melting sweetness by the old
woman's presence.

'Yes, I've been rather unlucky,' grunted Lady Ducayne.

'But I am sure Miss Rolleston will not disappoint you, though
certainly after your unpleasant experience with Miss Tomson, who
looked the picture of health--and Miss Blandy, who said she had never
seen a doctor since she was vaccinated--'

'Lies, no doubt,' muttered Lady Ducayne, and then turning to Bella,
she asked, curtly, 'You don't mind spending the winter in Italy, I
suppose?'

In Italy! The very word was magical. Bella's fair young face flushed
crimson.

'It has been the dream of my life to see Italy,' she gasped.

From Walworth to Italy! How far, how impossible such a journey had
seemed to that romantic dreamer.

'Well, your dream will be realized. Get yourself ready to leave
Charing Cross by the train deluxe this day week at eleven. Be sure you
are at the station a quarter before the hour. My people will look
after you and your luggage.'

Lady Ducayne rose from her chair, assisted by her crutch-stick, and
Miss Torpinter escorted her to the door.

'And with regard to salary?' questioned the Person on the way.

'Salary, oh, the same as usual--and if the young woman wants a
quarter's pay in advance you can write to me for a cheque,' Lady
Ducayne answered, carelessly.

Miss Torpinter went all the way downstairs with her client, and waited
to see her seated in the yellow chariot. When she came upstairs again
she was slightly out of breath, and she had resumed that superior
manner which Bella had found so crushing.

'You may think yourself uncommonly lucky, Miss Rolleston,' she said.
'I have dozens of young ladies on my books whom I might have
recommended for this situation--but I remembered having told you to
call this afternoon--and I thought I would give you a chance.

Old Lady Ducayne is one of the best people on my books. She gives her
companion a hundred a year, and pays all travelling expenses. You will
live in the lap of luxury.'

'A hundred a year! How too lovely! Shall I have to dress very grandly?
Does Lady Ducayne keep much company?'

'At her age! No, she lives in seclusion--in her own apartments--her
French maid, her footman, her medical attendant, her courier.'

'Why did those other companions leave her?' asked Bella.

'Their health broke down!'

'Poor things, and so they had to leave?'

'Yes, they had to leave. I suppose you would like a quarter's salary
in advance?'

'Oh, yes, please. I shall have things to buy.'

'Very well, I will write for Lady Ducayne's cheque, and I will send
you the balance--after deducting my commission for the year.'

'To be sure, I had forgotten the commission.'

'You don't suppose I keep this office for pleasure.'

'Of course not,' murmured Bella, remembering the five shillings
entrance fee; but nobody could expect a hundred a year and a winter in
Italy for five shillings.



Chapter III



'From Miss Rolleston, at Cap Ferrino, to Mrs Rolleston, in Beresford
Street, Walworth.

'How I wish you could see this place, dearest; the blue sky, the olive
woods, the orange and lemon orchards between the cliffs and the sea--
sheltering in the hollow of the great hills--and with summer waves
dancing up to the narrow ridge of pebbles and weeds which is the
Italian idea of a beach! Oh, how I wish you could see it all, mother
dear, and bask in this sunshine, that makes it so difficult to believe
the date at the head of this paper. November! The air is like an
English June--the sun is so hot that I can't walk a few yards without
an umbrella. And to think of you at Walworth while I am here! I could
cry at the thought that perhaps you will never see this lovely coast,
this wonderful sea, these summer flowers that bloom in winter. There
is a hedge of pink geraniums under my window, mother--a thick, rank
hedge, as if the flowers grew wild---and there are Dijon roses
climbing over arches and palisades all along the terrace--a rose garden
full of bloom in November! Just picture it all! You could never
imagine the luxury of this hotel.

It is nearly new, and has been built and decorated regardless of
expense. Our rooms are upholstered in pale blue satin, which shows up
Lady Ducayne's parchment complexion; but as she sits all day in a
corner of the balcony basking in the sun, except when she is in her
carriage, and all the evening in her armchair close to the fire, and
never sees anyone but her own people, her complexion matters very
little.

'She has the handsomest suite of rooms in the hotel. My bedroom is
inside hers, the sweetest room--all blue satin and white lace--white
enamelled furniture, looking-glasses on every wall, till I know my
pert little profile as I never knew it before. The room was really
meant for Lady Ducayne's dressing-room, but she ordered one of the
blue satin couches to be arranged as a bed for me--the prettiest little
bed, which I can wheel near the window on sunny mornings, as it is on
castors and easily moved about. I feel as if Lady Ducayne were a funny
old grandmother, who had suddenly appeared in my life, very, very
rich, and very, very kind.

'She is not at all exacting. I read aloud to her a good deal, and she
dozes and nods while I read.

Sometimes I hear her moaning in her sleep--as if she had troublesome
dreams. When she is tired of my reading she orders Francine, her maid,
to read a French novel to her, and I hear her chuckle and groan now
and then, as if she were more interested in those books than in
Dickens or Scott. My French is not good enough to follow Francine, who
reads very quickly. I have a great deal of liberty, for Lady Ducayne
often tells me to run away and amuse myself; I roam about the hills
for hours. Everything is so lovely. I lose myself in olive woods,
always climbing up and up towards the pine woods above--and above the
pines there are the snow mountains that just show their white peaks
above the dark hills. Oh, you poor dear, how can I ever make you
understand what this place is like--you, whose poor, tired eyes have
only the opposite side of Beresford Street? Sometimes I go no farther
than the terrace in front of the hotel, which is a favourite lounging-
place with everybody. The gardens lie below, and the tennis courts
where I sometimes play with a very nice girl, the only person in the
hotel with whom I have made friends. She is a year older than I, and
has come to Cap Ferrino with her brother, a doctor--or a medical
student, who is going to be a doctor. He passed his M.B. exam at
Edinburgh just before they left home, Lotta told me. He came to Italy
entirely on his sister's account. She had a troublesome chest attack
last summer and was ordered to winter abroad. They are orphans, quite
alone in the world, and so fond of each other. It is very nice for me
to have such a friend as Lotta. She is so thoroughly respectable. I
can't help using that word, for some of the girls in this hotel go on
in a way that I know you would shudder at. Lotta was brought up by an
aunt, deep down in the country, and knows hardly anything about life.
Her brother won't allow her to read a novel, French or English, that
he has not read and approved.

'"He treats me like a child," she told me, "but I don't mind, for it's
nice to know somebody loves me, and cares about what I do, and even
about my thoughts."

'Perhaps this is what makes some girls so eager to marry--the want of
someone strong and brave and honest and true to care for them and
order them about. I want no one, mother darling, for I have you, and
you are all the world to me. No husband could ever come between us
two. If I ever were to marry he would have only the second place in my
heart. But I don't suppose I ever shall marry, or even know what it is
like to have an offer of marriage. No young man can afford to marry a
penniless girl nowadays. Life is too expensive.'

'Mr Stafford, Lotta's brother, is very clever, and very kind. He
thinks it is rather hard for me to have to live with such an old woman
as Lady Ducayne, but then he does not know how poor we are--you and I--
and what a wonderful life this seems to me in this lovely place. I
feel a selfish wretch for enjoying all my luxuries, while you, who
want them so much more than I, have none of them--hardly know what
they are like--do you, dearest?--for my scamp of a father began to go
to the dogs soon after you were married, and since then life has been
all trouble and care and struggle for you.'

This letter was written when Bella had been less than a month at Cap
Ferrino, before the novelty had worn off the landscape, and before the
pleasure of luxurious surroundings had begun to cloy. She wrote to her
mother every week, such long letters as girls who have lived in
closest companionship with a mother alone can write; letters that are
like a diary of heart and mind. She wrote gaily always; but when the
new year began Mrs Rolleston thought she detected a note of melancholy
under all those lively details about the place and the people.

'My poor girl is getting homesick,' she thought. 'Her heart is in
Beresford Street.'

It might be that she missed her new friend and companion, Lotta
Stafford, who had gone with her brother for a little tour to Genoa and
Spezzia, and as far as Pisa. They were to return before February; but
in the meantime Bella might naturally feel very solitary among all
those strangers, whose manners and doings she described so well.

The mother's instinct had been true. Bella was not so happy as she had
been in that first flush of wonder and delight which followed the
change from Walworth to the Riviera. Somehow, she knew not how,
lassitude had crept upon her. She no longer loved to climb the hills,
no longer flourished her orange stick in sheer gladness of heart as
her light feet skipped over the rough ground and the coarse grass on
the mountain side. The odour of rosemary and thyme, the fresh breath
of the sea, no longer filled her with rapture. She thought of
Beresford Street and her mother's face with a sick longing. They were
so far--so far away! And then she thought of Lady Ducayne, sitting by
the heaped-up olive logs in the over-heated salon--thought of that
wizened nut-cracker profile, and those gleaming eyes, with an
invincible horror.

Visitors at the hotel had told her that the air of Cap Ferrino was
relaxing--better suited to age than to youth, to sickness than to
health. No doubt it was so. She was not so well as she had been at
Walworth; but she told herself that she was suffering only from the
pain of separation from the dear companion of her girlhood, the mother
who had been nurse, sister, friend, flatterer, all things in this
world to her. She had shed many tears over that parting, had spent
many a melancholy hour on the marble terrace with yearning eyes
looking westward, and with her heart's desire a thousand miles away.

She was sitting in her favourite spot, an angle at the eastern end of
the terrace, a quiet little nook sheltered by orange trees, when she
heard a couple of Riviera habitués talking in the garden below. They
were sitting on a bench against the terrace wall.

She had no idea of listening to their talk, till the sound of Lady
Ducayne's name attracted her, and then she listened without any
thought of wrong-doing. They were talking no secrets--just casually
discussing an hotel acquaintance.

They were two elderly people whom Bella only knew by sight. An English
clergyman who had wintered abroad for half his lifetime; a stout,
comfortable, well-to-do spinster, whose chronic bronchitis obliged her
to migrate annually.

'I have met her about Italy for the last ten years,' said the lady;
'but have never found out her real age.

'I put her down at a hundred--not a year less,' replied the parson.
'Her reminiscences all go back to the Regency. She was evidently then
in her zenith; and I have heard her say things that showed she was in
Parisian society when the First Empire was at its best--before
Josephine was divorced.'

'She doesn't talk much now.'

'No; there's not much life left in her. She is wise in keeping herself
secluded. I only wonder that wicked old quack, her Italian doctor,
didn't finish her off years ago.'

'I should think it must be the other way, and that he keeps her
alive.'

'My dear Miss Manders, do you think foreign quackery ever kept anybody
alive?'

'Well, there she is--and she never goes anywhere without him. He
certainly has an unpleasant countenance.'

'Unpleasant,' echoed the parson, 'I don't believe the foul fiend
himself can beat him in ugliness. I pity that poor young woman who has
to live between old Lady Ducayne and Dr Parravicini.'

'But the old lady is very good to her companions.'

'No doubt. She is very free with her cash; the servants call her good
Lady Ducayne. She is a withered old female Croesus, and knows she'll
never be able to get through her money, and doesn't relish the idea of
other people enjoying it when she's in her coffin. People who live to
be as old as she is become slavishly attached to life. I daresay she's
generous to those poor girls---but she can't make them happy. They die
in her service.'

'Don't say they, Mr Carton; I know that one poor girl died at Mentone
last spring.'

'Yes, and another poor girl died in Rome three years ago. I was there
at the time. Good Lady Ducayne left her there in an English family.
The girl had every comfort. The old woman was very liberal to her--but
she died. I tell you, Miss Manders, it is not good for any young woman
to live with two such horrors as Lady Ducayne and Parravicini. They
talked of other things--but Bella hardly heard them. She sat
motionless, and a cold wind seemed to come down upon her from the
mountains and to creep up to her from the sea, till she shivered as
she sat there in the sunshine, in the shelter of the orange trees in
the midst of all that beauty and brightness.

Yes, they were uncanny, certainly, the pair of them--she so like an
aristocratic witch in her withered old age; he of no particular age,
with a face that was more like a waxen mask than any human countenance
Bella had ever seen. What did it matter? Old age is venerable, and
worthy of all reverence; and Lady Ducayne had been very kind to her.
Dr Parravicini was a harmless, inoffensive student, who seldom looked
up from the book he was reading. He had his private sitting-room,
where he made experiments in chemistry and natural science--perhaps in
alchemy.

What could it matter to Bella? He had always been polite to her, in
his far-off way. She could not be more happily placed than she was--in
this palatial hotel, with this rich old lady.

No doubt she missed the young English girl who had been so friendly,
and it might be that she missed the girl's brother, for Mr Stafford
had talked to her a good deal--had interested himself in the books she
was reading, and her manner of amusing herself when she was not on
duty.

You must come to our little salon when you are "off," as the hospital
nurses call it, and we can have some music. No doubt you play and
sing?' upon which Bella had to own with a blush of shame that she had
forgotten how to play the piano ages ago.

Mother and I used to sing duets sometimes between the lights, without
accompaniment,' she said, and the tears came into her eyes as she
thought of the humble room, the half-hour's respite from work, the
sewing-machine standing where a piano ought to have been, and her
mother's plaintive voice, so sweet, so true, so dear.

Sometimes she found herself wondering whether she would ever see that
beloved mother again. Strange forebodings came into her mind. She was
angry with herself for giving way to melancholy thoughts.

One day she questioned Lady Ducayne's French maid about those two
companions who had died within three years.

'They were poor, feeble creatures,' Francine told her. 'They looked
fresh and bright enough when they came to Miladi; but they ate too
much and they were lazy. They died of luxury and idleness. Miladi was
too kind to them. They had nothing to do; and so they took to fancying
things; fancying the air didn't suit them, that they couldn't sleep.'

'I sleep well enough, but I have had a strange dream several times
since I have been in Italy.'

'Ah, you had better not begin to think about dreams, or you will be
like those other girls. They were dreamers--and they dreamt themselves
into the cemetery.'

The dream troubled her a little, not because it was a ghastly or
frightening dream, but on account of sensations which she had never
felt before in sleep--a whirring of wheels that went round in her
brain, a great noise like a whirlwind, but rhythmical like the ticking
of a gigantic clock: and then in the midst of this uproar as of winds
and waves she seemed to sink into a gulf of unconsciousness, out of
sleep into far deeper sleep--total extinction. And then, after that
blank interval, there had come the sound of voices, and then again the
whirr of wheels, louder and louder--and again the blank--and then she
knew no more till morning, when she awoke, feeling languid and
oppressed.

She told Dr Parravicini of her dream one day, on the only occasion
when she wanted his professional advice. She had suffered rather
severely from the mosquitoes before Christmas---and had been almost
frightened at finding a wound upon her arm which she could only
attribute to the venomous sting of one of these torturers. Parravicini
put on his glasses, and scrutinized the angry mark on the round, white
arm, as Bella stood before him and Lady Ducayne with her sleeve rolled
up above her elbow.

'Yes, that's rather more than a joke,' he said, 'he has caught you on
the top of a vein. What a vampire! But there's no harm done,
signorina, nothing that a little dressing of mine won't heal.

You must always show me any bite of this nature. It might be dangerous
if neglected. These creatures feed on poison and disseminate it.'

'And to think that such tiny creatures can bite like this,' said
Bella; 'my arm looks as if it had been cut by a knife.'

'If I were to show you a mosquito's sting under my microscope you
wouldn't be surprised at that,' replied Parravicini.

Bella had to put up with the mosquito bites, even when they came on
the top of a vein, and produced that ugly wound. The wound recurred
now and then at longish intervals, and Bella found Dr Parravicini's
dressing a speedy cure. If he were the quack his enemies called him,
he had at least a light hand and a delicate touch in performing this
small operation.

'Bella Rolleston to Mrs Rolleston--April 14th.

'Ever Dearest,--Behold the cheque for my second quarter's salary--five
and twenty pounds.

There is no one to pinch off a whole tenner for a year's commission as
there was last time, so it is all for you, mother, dear. I have plenty
of pocket-money in hand from the cash I brought away with me, when you
insisted on my keeping more than I wanted. It isn't possible to spend
money here--except on occasional tips to servants, or sous to beggars
and children--unless one had lots to spend, for everything one would
like to buy--tortoise-shell, coral, lace--is so ridiculously dear that
only a millionaire ought to look at it. Italy is a dream of beauty:
but for shopping, give me Newington Causeway.

'You ask me so earnestly if I am quite well that I fear my letters
must have been very dull lately. Yes, dear, I am well--but I am not
quite so strong as I was when I used to trudge to the West-end to buy
half a pound of tea--just for a constitutional walk--or to Dulwich to
look at the pictures. Italy is relaxing; and I feel what the people
here call "slack". But I fancy I can see your dear face looking
worried as you read this. Indeed, and indeed, I am not ill. I am only
a little tired of this lovely scene--as I suppose one might get tired
of looking at one of Turner's pictures if it hung on a wall that was
always opposite one. I think of you every hour in every day--think of
you and our homely little room--our dear little shabby parlour, with
the armchairs from the wreck of your old home, and Dick singing in his
cage over the sewing-machine. Dear, shrill, maddening Dick, who, we
flattered ourselves, was so passionately fond of us. Do tell me in
your next that he is well.

'My friend Lotta and her brother never came back after all. They went
from Pisa to Rome.

Happy mortals! And they are to be on the Italian lakes in May; which
lake was not decided when Lotta last wrote to me. She has been a
charming correspondent, and has confided all her little flirtations to
me. We are all to go to Bellaggio next week--by Genoa and Milan. Isn't
that lovely? Lady Ducayne travels by the easiest stages--except when
she is bottled up in the train de luxe. We shall stop two days at
Genoa and one at Milan. What a bore I shall be to you with my talk
about Italy when I come home.

'Love and love--and ever more love from your adoring, Bella.'



Chapter IV



Herbert Stafford and his sister had often talked of the pretty English
girl with her fresh complexion, which made such a pleasant touch of
rosy colour among all those sallow faces at the Grand Hotel. The young
doctor thought of her with a compassionate tenderness--her utter
loneliness in that great hotel where there were so many people, her
bondage to that old, old woman, where everybody else was free to think
of nothing but enjoying life. It was a hard fate; and the poor child
was evidently devoted to her mother, and felt the pain of separation--
only two of them, and very poor, and all the world to each other, he
thought.

Lotta told him one morning that they were to meet again at Bellaggio.
'The old thing and her court are to be there before we are,' she said.
'I shall be charmed to have Bella again. She is so bright and gay--in
spite of an occasional touch of homesickness. I never took to a girl
on a short acquaintance as I did to her.'

'I like her best when she is homesick,' said Herbert; 'for then I am
sure she has a heart.'

'What have you to do with hearts, except for dissection? Don't forget
that Bella is an absolute pauper. She told me in confidence that her
mother makes mantles for a West-end shop. You can hardly have a lower
depth than that.'

'I shouldn't think any less of her if her mother made match-boxes.'

'Not in the abstract--of course not. Match-boxes are honest labour.
But you couldn't marry a girl whose mother makes mantles.'

'We haven't come to the consideration of that question yet,' answered
Herbert, who liked to provoke his sister.

In two years' hospital practice he had seen too much of the grim
realities of life to retain any prejudices about rank. Cancer,
phthisis, gangrene, leave a man with little respect for the outward
differences which vary the husk of humanity. The kernel is always the
same--fearfully and wonderfully made--a subject for pity and terror.

Mr Stafford and his sister arrived at Bellaggio in a fair May evening.
The sun was going down as the steamer approached the pier; and all
that glory of purple bloom which curtains every wall at this season of
the year flushed and deepened in the glowing light. A group of ladies
were standing on the pier watching the arrivals, and among them
Herbert saw a pale face that startled him out of his wonted composure.

'There she is,' murmured Lotta, at his elbow, 'but how dreadfully
changed. She looks a wreck.'

They were shaking hands with her a few minutes later, and a flush had
lighted up her poor pinched face in the pleasure of meeting.

'I thought you might come this evening,' she said. 'We have been here
a week.'

She did not add that she had been there every evening to watch the
boat in, and a good many times during the day. The Grand Bretagne was
close by, and it had been easy for her to creep to the pier when the
boat bell rang. She felt a joy in meeting these people again; a sense
of being with friends; a confidence which Lady Ducayne's goodness had
never inspired in her.

'Oh, you poor darling, how awfully ill you must have been, exclaimed
Lotta, as the two girls embraced.

Bella tried to answer, but her voice was choked with tears.

'What has been the matter, dear? That horrid influenza, I suppose?'

'No, no, I have not been ill--I have only felt a little weaker than I
used to be. I don't think the air of Cap Ferrino quite agreed with
me.'

'It must have disagreed with you abominably. I never saw such a change
in anyone. Do let Herbert doctor you. He is fully qualified, you know.
He prescribed for ever so many influenza patients at the Londres. They
were glad to get advice from an English doctor in a friendly way.'

'I am sure he must be very clever!' faltered Bella, 'but there is
really nothing the matter. I am not ill, and if I were ill, Lady
Ducayne's physician--'

'That dreadful man with the yellow face? I would as soon one of the
Borgias prescribed for me. I hope you haven't been taking any of his
medicines.'

'No, dear, I have taken nothing. I have never complained of being
ill.'

This was said while they were all three walking to the hotel. The
Staffords' rooms had been secured in advance, pretty ground-floor
rooms, opening into the garden. Lady Ducayne's statelier apartments
were on the floor above.

'I believe these rooms are just under ours,' said Bella.

'Then it will be all the easier for you to run down to us,' replied
Lotta, which was not really the case, as the grand staircase was in
the centre of the hotel.

'Oh, I shall find it easy enough,' said Bella. 'I'm afraid you'll have
too much of my society.

Lady Ducayne sleeps away half the day in this warm weather, so I have
a good deal of idle time; and I get awfully moped thinking of mother
and home.'

Her voice broke upon the last word. She could not have thought of that
poor lodging which went by the name of home more tenderly had it been
the most beautiful that art and wealth ever created. She moped and
pined in this lovely garden, with the sunlit lake and the romantic
hills spreading out their beauty before her. She was homesick and she
had dreams: or, rather, an occasional recurrence of that one bad dream
with all its strange sensations--it was more like a hallucination than
dreaming--the whirring of wheels; the sinking into an abyss; the
struggling back to consciousness. She had the dream shortly before she
left Cap Ferrino, but not since she had come to Bellaggio, and she
began to hope the air in this lake district suited her better, and
that those strange sensations would never return.

Mr Stafford wrote a prescription and had it made up at the chemist's
near the hotel. It was a powerful tonic, and after two bottles, and a
row or two on the lake, and some rambling over the hills and in the
meadows where the spring flowers made earth seem paradise, Bella's
spirits and looks improved as if by magic.

'It is a wonderful tonic,' she said, but perhaps in her heart of
hearts she knew that the doctor's kind voice and the friendly hand
that helped her in and out of the boat, and the watchful care that
went with her by land and lake, had something to do with her cure.

'I hope you don't forget that her mother makes mantles,' Lotta said,
warningly.

'Or match-boxes: it is just the same thing, so far as I am concerned.'

'You mean that in no circumstances could you think of marrying her?'

'I mean that if ever I love a woman well enough to think of marrying
her, riches or rank will count for nothing with me. But I fear--I fear
your poor friend may not live to be any man's wife.'

'Do you think her so very ill?'

He sighed, and left the question unanswered.

One day, while they were gathering wild hyacinths in an upland meadow,
Bella told Mr Stafford about her bad dream.

'It is curious only because it is hardly like a dream,' she said. 'I
daresay you could find some common-sense reason for it. The position
of my head on my pillow, or the atmosphere, or something.'

And then she described her sensations; how in the midst of sleep there
came a sudden sense of suffocation; and then those whirring wheels, so
loud, so terrible; and then a blank, and then a coming back to waking
consciousness.

'Have you ever had chloroform given you--by a dentist, for instance?'

'Never--Dr Parravicini asked me that question one day.

'Lately?'

'No, long ago, when we were in the train de luxe.'

'Has Dr Parravicini prescribed for you since you began to feel weak
and ill?'

'Oh, he has given me a tonic from time to time, but I hate medicine,
and took very little of the stuff. And then I am not ill, only weaker
than I used to be. I was ridiculously strong and well when I lived at
Walworth, and used to take long walks every day. Mother made me take
those tramps to Dulwich or Norwood, for fear I should suffer from too
much sewing-machine; sometimes--but very seldom--she went with me. She
was generally toiling at home while I was enjoying fresh air and
exercise. And she was very careful about our food--that, however plain
it was, it should be always nourishing and ample. I owe all to her care
that I grew up such a great, strong creature.'

'You don't look great or strong now, you poor dear,' said Lotta.

'I'm afraid Italy doesn't agree with me.'

'Perhaps it is not Italy, but being cooped up with Lady Ducayne that
has made you ill.'

'But I am never cooped up. Lady Ducayne is absurdly kind, and lets me
roam about or sit in the balcony all day if I like. I have read more
novels since I have been with her than in all the rest of my life.'

'Then she is very different from the average old lady, who is usually
a slave-driver,' said Stafford. 'I wonder why she carries a companion
about with her if she has so little need of society.'

'Oh, I am only part of her state. She is inordinately rich--and the
salary she gives me doesn't count. Apropos of Dr Parravicini, I know
he is a clever doctor, for he cures my horrid mosquito bites.'

'A little ammonia would do that, in the early stage of the mischief.
But there are no mosquitoes to trouble you now.'

'Oh, yes, there are, I had a bite just before we left Cap Ferrino.

She pushed up her loose lawn sleeve, and exhibited a scar, which he
scrutinized intently, with a surprised and puzzled look.

'This is no mosquito bite,' he said.

'Oh, yes it is--unless there are snakes or adders at Cap Ferrino.'

'It is not a bite at all. You are trifling with me. Miss Rolleston--
you have allowed that wretched Italian quack to bleed you. They killed
the greatest man in modern Europe that way, remember. How very foolish
of you.'

'I was never bled in my life, Mr Stafford.'

'Nonsense! Let me look at your other arm. Are there any more mosquito
bites?'

'Yes; Dr Parravicini says I have a bad skin for healing, and that the
poison acts more virulently with me than with most people.'

Stafford examined both her arms in the broad sunlight, scars new and
old.

'You have been very badly bitten, Miss Rolleston,' he said, 'and if
ever I find the mosquito I shall make him smart. But, now tell me, my
dear girl, on your word of honour, tell me as you would tell a friend
who is sincerely anxious for your health and happiness--as you would
tell your mother if she were here to question you--have you no
knowledge of any cause for these scars except mosquito bites--no
suspicion even?'

'No, indeed! No, upon my honour! I have never seen a mosquito biting
my arm. One never does see the horrid little fiends. But I have heard
them trumpeting under the curtains, and I know that I have often had
one of the pestilent wretches buzzing about me.

Later in the day Bella and her friends were sitting at tea in the
garden, while Lady Ducayne took her afternoon drive with her doctor.

'How long do you mean to stop with Lady Ducayne, Miss Rolleston?'
Herbert Stafford asked, after a thoughtful silence, breaking suddenly
upon the trivial talk of the two girls.

'As long as she will go on paying me twenty-five pounds a quarter.'

'Even if you feel your health breaking down in her service?'

'It is not the service that has injured my health. You can see that I
have really nothing to do---to read aloud for an hour or so once or
twice a week; to write a letter once in a while to a London tradesman. I
shall never have such an easy time with anybody else. And nobody else
would give me a hundred a year.'

'Then you mean to go on till you break down; to die at your post?'

'Like the other two companions? No! If ever I feel seriously ill--
really ill--I shall put myself in a train and go back to Walworth
without stopping.'

'What about the other two companions?'

'They both died. It was very unlucky for Lady Ducayne. That's why she
engaged me; she chose me because I was ruddy and robust. She must feel
rather disgusted at my having grown white and weak. By-the-bye, when I
told her about the good your tonic had done me, she said she would
like to see you and have a little talk with you about her own case.

'And I should like to see Lady Ducayne. When did she say this?'

'The day before yesterday.'

'Will you ask her if she will see me this evening?'

'With pleasure I wonder what you will think of her? She looks rather
terrible to a stranger; but Dr Parravicini says she was once a famous
beauty.'

It was nearly ten o'clock when Mr Stafford was summoned by message
from Lady Ducayne, whose courier came to conduct him to her ladyship's
salon. Bella was reading aloud when the visitor was admitted; and he
noticed the languor in the low, sweet tones, the evident effort.

'Shut up the book,' said the querulous old voice. 'You are beginning
to drawl like Miss Blandy.'

Stafford saw a small, bent figure crouching over the piled-up olive
logs; a shrunken old figure in a gorgeous garment of black and crimson
brocade, a skinny throat emerging from a mass of old Venetian lace,
clasped with diamonds that flashed like fire-flies as the trembling
old head turned towards him.

The eyes that looked at him out of the face were almost as bright as
the diamonds--the only living feature in that narrow parchment mask.
He had seen terrible faces in the hospital--faces on which disease had
set dreadful marks--but he had never seen a face that impressed him so
painfully as this withered countenance, with its indescribable horror
of death outlived, a face that should have been hidden under a coffin-
lid years and years ago.

The Italian physician was standing on the other side of the fireplace,
smoking a cigarette, and looking down at the little old woman brooding
over the hearth as if he were proud of her.

'Good evening, Mr Stafford; you can go to your room, Bella, and write
your everlasting letter to your mother at Walworth,' said Lady
Ducayne. 'I believe she writes a page about every wild flower she
discovers in the woods and meadows. I don't know what else she can
find to write about,' she added, as Bella quietly withdrew to the
pretty little bedroom opening out of Lady Ducayne's spacious
apartment. Here, as at Cap Ferrino, she slept in a room adjoining the
old lady's.

'You are a medical man, I understand, Mr Stafford.'

'I am a qualified practitioner, but I have not begun to practise.'

'You have begun upon my companion, she tells me.'

'I have prescribed for her, certainly, and I am happy to find my
prescription has done her good; but I look upon that improvement as
temporary. Her case will require more drastic treatment.

'Never mind her case. There is nothing the matter with the girl--
absolutely nothing--except girlish nonsense; too much liberty and not
enough work.'

'I understand that two of your ladyship's previous companions died of
the same disease,' said Stafford, looking first at Lady Ducayne, who
gave her tremulous old head an impatient jerk, and then at
Parravicini, whose yellow complexion had paled a little under
Stafford's scrutiny.

'Don't bother me about my companions, sir,' said Lady Ducayne. 'I sent
for you to consult you about myself--not about a parcel of anæmic
girls. You are young, and medicine is a progressive science, the
newspapers tell me. Where have you studied?'

'In Edinburgh--and in Paris.'

'Two good schools. And you know all the new-fangled theories, the
modern discoveries--that remind one of the mediæval witchcraft, of
Albertus Magnus, and George Ripley; you have studied hypnotism--
electricity?'

'And the transfusion of blood,' said Stafford, very slowly, looking at
Parravicini.

'Have you made any discovery that teaches you to prolong human life--
any elixir--any mode of treatment? I want my life prolonged, young
man. That man there has been my physician for thirty years. He does
all he can to keep me alive--after his lights. He studies all the new
theories of all the scientists--but he is old; he gets older every
day--his brain-power is going--he is bigoted--prejudiced--can't
receive new ideas--can't grapple with new systems. He will let me die
if I am not on my guard against him.'

'You are of an unbelievable ingratitude, Ecclenza,' said Parravicini.

'Oh, you needn't complain. I have paid you thousands to keep me alive.
Every year of my life has swollen your hoards; you know there is
nothing to come to you when I am gone. My whole fortune is left to
endow a home for indigent women of quality who have reached their
ninetieth year. Come, Mr Stafford, I am a rich woman. Give me a few
years more in the sunshine, a few years more above ground, and I will
give you the price of a fashionable London practice--I will set you up
at the West-end.'

'How old are you, Lady Ducayne?'

'I was born the day Louis XVI was guillotined.'

'Then I think you have had your share of the sunshine and the
pleasures of the earth, and that you should spend your few remaining
days in repenting your sins and trying to make atonement for the young
lives that have been sacrificed to your love of life.'

'What do you mean by that, sir?'

'Oh, Lady Ducayne, need I put your wickedness and your physician's
still greater wickedness in plain words? The poor girl who is now in
your employment has been reduced from robust health to a condition of
absolute danger by Dr Parravicini's experimental surgery; and I have
no doubt those other two young women who broke down in your service
were treated by him in the same manner. I could take upon myself to
demonstrate--by most convincing evidence, to a jury of medical men--
that Dr Parravicini has been bleeding Miss Rolleston, after putting
her under chloroform, at intervals, ever since she has been in your
service. The deterioration in the girl's health speaks for itself; the
lancet marks upon the girl's arms are unmistakable; and her
description of a series of sensations, which she calls a dream, points
unmistakably to the administration of chloroform while she was
sleeping. A practice so nefarious, so murderous, must, if exposed,
result in a sentence only less severe than the punishment of murder.'

'I laugh,' said Parravicini, with an airy motion of his skinny
fingers; 'I laugh at once at your theories and at your threats. I,
Parravicini Leopold, have no fear that the law can question anything I
have done.'

'Take the girl away, and let me hear no more of her,' cried Lady
Ducayne, in the thin, old voice, which so poorly matched the energy
and fire of the wicked old brain that guided its utterances. 'Let her
go back to her mother--I want no more girls to die in my service.
There are girls enough and to spare in the world, God knows.'

'If you ever engage another companion--or take another English girl
into your service, Lady Ducayne, I will make all England ring with the
story of your wickedness.'

'I want no more girls. I don't believe in his experiments. They have
been full of danger for me as well as for the girl--an air bubble, and
I should be gone. I'll have no more of his dangerous quackery. I'll
find some new man--a better man than you, sir, a discoverer like
Pasteur, or Virchow, a genius--to keep me alive. Take your girl away,
young man. Marry her if you like.

I'll write her a cheque for a thousand pounds, and let her go and live
on beef and beer, and get strong and plump again. I'll have no more
such experiments. Do you hear, Parravicini?' she screamed,
vindictively, the yellow, wrinkled face distorted with fury, the eyes
glaring at him.

The Staffords carried Bella Rolleston off to Varese next day, she very
loth to leave Lady Ducayne, whose liberal salary afforded such help
for the dear mother. Herbert Stafford insisted, however, treating
Bella as coolly as if he had been the family physician, and she had
been given over wholly to his care.

'Do you suppose your mother would let you stop here to die?' he asked.
'If Mrs Rolleston knew how ill you are, she would come post haste to
fetch you.

'I shall never be well again till I get back to Walworth,' answered
Bella, who was low-spirited and inclined to tears this morning, a
reaction after her good spirits of yesterday.

'We'll try a week or two at Varese first,' said Stafford. 'When you
can walk half-way up Monte Generoso without palpitation of the heart,
you shall go back to Walworth.'

'Poor mother, how glad she will be to see me, and how sorry that I've
lost such a good place.'

This conversation took place on the boat when they were leaving
Bellaggio. Lotta had gone to her friend's room at seven o'clock that
morning, long before Lady Ducayne's withered eyelids had opened to the
daylight, before even Francine, the French maid, was astir, and had
helped to pack a Gladstone bag with essentials, and hustled Bella
downstairs and out of doors before she could make any strenuous
resistance.

'It's all right.' Lotta assured her. 'Herbert had a good talk with
Lady Ducayne last night and it was settled for you to leave this
morning. She doesn't like invalids, you see.'

'No,' sighed Bella, 'she doesn't like invalids. It was very unlucky
that I should break down, just like Miss Tomson and Miss Blandy.'

'At any rate, you are not dead, like them,' answered Lotta, 'and my
brother says you are not going to die.'

It seemed rather a dreadful thing to be dismissed in that off-hand
way, without a word of farewell from her employer.

'I wonder what Miss Torpinter will say when I go to her for another
situation,' Bella speculated, ruefully, while she and her friends were
breakfasting on board the steamer.

'Perhaps you may never want another situation,' said Stafford.

'You mean that I may never be well enough to be useful to anybody?'

'No, I don't mean anything of the kind.'

It was after dinner at Varese, when Bella had been induced to take a
whole glass of Chianti, and quite sparkled after that unaccustomed
stimulant, that Mr Stafford produced a letter from his pocket.

'I forgot to give you Lady Ducayne's letter of adieu,' he said.

'What, did she write to me? I am so glad--I hated to leave her in such
a cool way; for after all she was very kind to me, and if I didn't
like her it was only because she was too dreadfully old.'

She tore open the envelope. The letter was short and to the point:

'Goodbye, child. Go and marry your doctor. I enclose a farewell gift
for your trousseau.---Adeline Ducayne.'

'A hundred pounds, a whole year's salary--no--why, it's for a--A
cheque for a thousand!' cried Bella. 'What a generous old soul! She
really is the dearest old thing.'

'She just missed being very dear to you, Bella,' said Stafford.

He had dropped into the use of her Christian name while they were on
board the boat. It seemed natural now that she was to be in his charge
till they all three went back to England.

'I shall take upon myself the privileges of an elder brother till we
land at Dover,' he said; 'after that--well, it must be as you please.'

The question of their future relations must have been satisfactorily
settled before they crossed the Channel, for Bella's next letter to
her mother communicated three startling facts.

First, that the enclosed cheque for £1,000 was to be invested in
debenture stock in Mrs Rolleston's name, and was to be her very own,
income and principal, for the rest of her life.

Next, that Bella was going home to Walworth immediately.

And last, that she was going to be married to Mr Herbert Stafford in
the following autumn.

'And I am sure you will adore him, mother, as much as I do,' wrote
Bella. 'It is all good Lady Ducayne's doing. I never could have
married if I had not secured that little nest-egg for you.

Herbert says we shall be able to add to it as the years go by, and
that wherever we live there shall be always a room in our house for
you. The word "mother-in-law" has no terrors for him.'



AT CHRIGHTON ABBEY

The Chrightons were very great people in that part of the country
where my childhood and youth were spent. To speak of Squire Chrighton
was to speak of a power in that remote western region of England.
Chrighton Abbey had belonged to the family ever since the reign of
Stephen, and there was a curious old wing and a cloistered quadrangle
still remaining of the original edifice, and in excellent
preservation. The rooms at this end of the house were low, and
somewhat darksome and gloomy, it is true; but, though rarely used,
they were perfectly habitable, and were of service on great occasions
when the Abbey was crowded with guests.

The central portion of the Abbey had been rebuilt in the reign of
Elizabeth, and was of noble and palatial proportions. The southern
wing, and a long music-room with eight tall narrow windows added on to
it, were as modern as the time of Anne. Altogether, the Abbey was a
very splendid mansion, and one of the chief glories of our County.

All the land in Chrighton parish, and for a long way beyond its
boundaries, belonged to the great Squire. The parish church was within
the park walls, and the living in the Squire's gift---not a very
valuable benefice, but a useful thing to bestow upon a younger son's
younger son, once in a way, or sometimes on a tutor or dependent of
the wealthy house.

I was a Chrighton, and my father, a distant cousin of the reigning
Squire, had been rector of Chrighton parish. His death left me utterly
unprovided for, and I was fain to go out into the bleak unknown world,
and earn my living in a position of dependence--a dreadful thing for a
Chrighton to be obliged to do.

Out of respect for the traditions and prejudices of my race, I made it
my business to seek employment abroad, where the degradation of one
Chrighton was not so likely to inflict shame upon the ancient house to
which I belonged. Happily for myself, I had been carefully educated,
and had industriously cultivated the usual modern accomplishments in
the calm retirement of the Vicarage. I was so fortunate as to obtain a
situation at Vienna, in a German family of high rank; and here I
remained seven years, laying aside year by year a considerable portion
of my liberal salary. When my pupils had grown up, my kind mistress
procured me a still more profitable position at St Petersburg, where I
remained five more years, at the end of which time I yielded to a
yearning that had been long growing upon me--an ardent desire to see
my dear old country home once more.

I had no very near relations in England. My mother had died some years
before my father; my only brother was far away, in the Indian Civil
Service; sister I had none. But I was a Chrighton, and I loved the
soil from which I had sprung. I was sure, moreover, of a warm welcome
from friends who had loved and honoured my father and mother, and I
was still further encouraged to treat myself to this holiday by the
very cordial letters I had from time to time received from the
Squire's wife, a noble warm-hearted woman, who fully approved the
independent course I had taken, and who had ever shown herself my
friend.

In all her letters for some time past Mrs Chrighton begged that,
whenever I felt myself justified in coming home, I would pay a long
visit to the Abbey.

'I wish you could come at Christmas,' she wrote, in the autumn of the
year of which I am speaking. 'We shall be very gay, and I expect all
kinds of pleasant people at the Abbey. Edward is to be married early
in the spring--much to his father's satisfaction, for the match is a
good and appropriate one. His fiancéeis to be among our guests. She is
a very beautiful girl; perhaps I should say handsome rather than
beautiful. Julia Tremaine, one of the Tremaines of Old Court, near
Hayswell--a very old family, as I daresay you remember. She has
several brothers and sisters, and will have little, perhaps nothing,
from her father; but she has a considerable fortune lefther by an
aunt, and is thought quite an heiress in the County--not, of course,
that this latter fact had any influence with Edward. He fell in love
with her at an assize ball in his usual impulsive fashion, and
proposed to her in something less than a fortnight. It is, I hope and
believe, a thorough love-match on both sides.'

After this followed a cordial repetition of the invitation to myself.
I was to go straight to the Abbey when I went to England, and was to
take up my abode there as long as ever I pleased.

This letter decided me. The wish to look on the dear scenes of my
happy childhood had grown almost into a pain. I was free to take a
holiday, without detriment to my prospects. So, early in December,
regardless of the bleak dreary weather, I turned my face homewards,
and made the long journey from St Petersburg to London, under the kind
escort of Major Manson, a Queen's Messenger, who was a friend of my
late employer, the Baron Fruydorff, and whose courtesy had been
enlisted for me by that gentleman.

I was three-and-thirty years of age. Youth was quite gone; beauty I
had never possessed; and I was content to think of myself as a
confirmed old maid, a quiet spectator of life's great drama, disturbed
by no feverish desire for an active part in the play. I had a
disposition to which this kind of passive existence is easy. There was
no wasting fire in my veins. Simple duties, rare and simple pleasures,
filled up my sum of life. The dear ones who had given a special charm
and brightness to my existence were gone. Nothing could recall them,
and without them actual happiness seemed impossible to me. Everything
had a subdued and neutral tint; life at its best was calm and
colourless, like a grey sunless day in early autumn, serene but
joyless.

The old Abbey was in its glory when I arrived there, at about nine
o'clock on a clear starlit night. A light frost whitened the broad
sweep of grass that stretched away from the long stone terrace in
front of the house to a semicircle of grand old oaks and beeches. From
the music-room at the end of the southern wing, to the heavily framed
gothic windows of the old rooms on the north, there shone one blaze of
light. The scene reminded me of some weird palace in a German legend;
and I half expected to see the lights fade out all in a moment, and
the long stone façade wrapped in sudden darkness.

The old butler, whom I remembered from my very infancy, and who did
not seem to have grown a day older during my twelve years' exile, came
out of the dining-room as the footman opened the hall-door for me, and
gave me cordial welcome, nay insisted upon helping to bring in my
portmanteau with his own hands, an act of unusual condescension, the
full force of which was felt by his subordinates.

'It's a real treat to see your pleasant face once more, Miss Sarah,'
said this faithful retainer, as he assisted me to take off my
travelling-cloak, and took my dressing-bag from my hand 'You look a
trifle older than when you used to live at the Vicarage twelve year
ago, but you're looking uncommon well for all that; and, Lord love
your heart, miss, how pleased they all will be to see you! Missus told
me with her own lips about your coming. You'd like to take off your
bonnet before you go to the drawing-room, I daresay. The house is full
of company. Call Mrs Marjorum, James, will you?'

The footman disappeared into the back regions, and presently eappeared
with Mrs Marjorum, a portly dame, who, like Truefold the butler, had
been a fixture at the Abbey in the time of the present Squire's
father. From her I received the same cordial greeting, and by her I
was led off up staircases and along corridors, till I wondered where I
was being taken.

We arrived at last at a very comfortable room--a square tapestried
chamber, with a low ceiling supported by a great oaken beam. The room
looked cheery enough, with a bright fire roaring in the wide chimney;
but it had a somewhat ancient aspect, which the superstitiously
inclined might have associated with possible ghosts.

I was fortunately of a matter-of-fact disposition, utterly sceptical
upon the ghost subject; and the old-fashioned appearance of the room
took my fancy.

'We are in King Stephen's wing, are we not, Mrs Marjorum?' I asked;
'this room seems quite strange to me. I doubt if I have ever been in
it before.'

'Very likely not, miss. Yes, this is the old wing. Your window looks
out into the old stable-yard, where the kennel used to be in the time
of our Squire's grandfather, when the Abbey was even a finer place
than it is now, I've heard say. We are so full of company this winter,
you see, miss, that we are obliged to make use of all these rooms.
You'll have no need to feel lonesome.

There's Captain and Mrs Cranwick in the next room to this, and the two
Miss Newports in the blue room opposite.'

'My dear good Marjorum, I like my quarters excessively; and I quite
enjoy the idea of sleeping in a room that was extant in the time of
Stephen, when the Abbey really was an abbey. I daresay some grave old
monk has worn these boards with his devout knees.'

The old woman stared dubiously, with the air of a person who had small
sympathy with monkish times, and begged to be excused for leaving me,
she had so much on her hands just now.

There was coffee to be sent in; and she doubted if the still-room maid
would manage matters properly, if she, Mrs Marjorum, were not at hand
to see that things were right.

'You've only to ring your bell, miss, and Susan will attend to you.
She's used to help waiting on our young ladies sometimes, and she's
very handy. Missus has given particular orders that she should be
always at your service.'

'Mrs Chrighton is very kind; but I assure you, Marjorum, I don't
require the help of a maid once in a month. I am accustomed to do
everything for myself. There, run along, Mrs Marjorum, and see after
your coffee; and I'll be down in the drawing-room in ten minutes. Are
there many people there, by the bye?'

'A good many. There's Miss Tremaine, and her mamma and younger sister;
of course you've heard all about the marriage--such a handsome young
lady--rather too proud for my liking; but the Tremaines always were a
proud family, and this one's an heiress. Mr Edward is so fond of her--
thinks the ground is scarcely good enough for her to walk upon, I do
believe; and somehow I can't help wishing he'd chosen someone else--
someone who would have thought more of him, and who would not take all
his attentions in such a cool offhand way. But of course it isn't my
business to say such things, and I wouldn't venture upon it to any
one but you, Miss Sarah.'

She told me that I would find dinner ready for me in the breakfast-
room, and then bustled off, leaving me to my toilet.

This ceremony I performed as rapidly as I could, admiring the perfect
comfort of my chamber as I dressed. Every modern appliance had been
added to the sombre and ponderous furniture of an age gone by, and the
combination produced a very pleasant effect. Perfume-bottles of ruby-
coloured Bohemian glass, china brush-trays and ring-stands brightened
the massive oak dressing-table; a low luxurious chintz-covered easy-
chair of the Victorian era stood before the hearth; a dear little
writing-table of polished maple was placed conveniently near it; and
in the background the tapestried walls loomed duskily, as they had
done hundreds of years before my time.

I had no leisure for dreamy musings on the past, however, provocative
though the chamber might be of such thoughts. I arranged my hair in
its usual simple fashion, and put on a dark-grey silk dress, trimmed
with some fine old black lace that had been given to me by the
Baroness--an unobtrusive demi-toilette, adapted to any occasion. I
tied a massive gold cross, an ornament that had belonged to my dear
mother, round my neck with a scarlet ribbon; and my costume was
complete. One glance at the looking-glass convinced me that there was
nothing dowdy in my appearance; and then I hurried along the corridor
and down the staircase to the hall, where Truefold received me and
conducted me to the breakfast-room, in which an excellent dinner
awaited me.

I did not waste much time over this repast, although I had eaten
nothing all day; for I was anxious to make my way to the drawing-room.
Just as I had finished, the door opened, and Mrs Chrighton sailed in,
looking superb in a dark-green velvet dress richly trimmed with old
point lace. She had been a beauty in her youth, and, as a matron, was
still remarkably handsome. She had, above all, a charm of expression
which to me was rarer and more delightful than her beauty of feature
and complexion.

She put her arms round me, and kissed me affectionately.

'I have only this moment been told of your arrival, my dear Sarah,'
she said; 'and I find you have been in the house half an hour. What
must you have thought of me!'

'What can I think of you, except that you are all goodness, my dear
Fanny? I did not expect you to leave your guests to receive me, and am
really sorry that you have done so. I need no ceremony to convince me
of your kindness.'

'But, my dear child, it is not a question of ceremony. I have been
looking forward so anxiously to your coming, and I should not have
liked to see you for the first time before all those people.

Give me another kiss, that's a darling. Welcome to Chrighton.
Remember, Sarah, this house is always to be your home, whenever you
have need of one.

'My dear kind cousin! And you are not ashamed of me, who have eaten
the bread of strangers?'

'Ashamed of you! No, my love; I admire your industry and spirit. And
now come to the drawing-room. The girls will be so pleased to see
you.'

'And I to see them. They were quite little things when I went away,
romping in the hay-fields in their short white frocks; and now, I
suppose, they are handsome young women.

'They are very nice-looking; not as handsome as their brother. Edward
is really a magnificent young man. I do not think my maternal pride
is guilty of any gross exaggeration when I say that.'

'And Miss Tremaine?' I said. 'I am very curious to see her.'

I fancied a faint shadow came over my cousin's face as I mentioned
this name.

'Miss Tremaine--yes--you cannot fail to admire her,' she said, rather
thoughtfully.

She drew my hand through her arm and led me to the drawing-room: a
very large room, with a fireplace at each end, brilliantly lighted
tonight, and containing about twenty people, scattered about in little
groups, and all seeming to be talking and laughing merrily. Mrs
Chrighton took me straight to one of the fireplaces, beside which two
girls were sitting on a low sofa, while a young man of something more
than six feet high stood near them, with his arm resting on the broad
marble slab of the mantelpiece. A glance told me that this young man
with the dark eyes and crisp waving brown hair was Edward Chrighton.
His likeness to his mother was in itself enough to tell me who he was;
but I remembered the boyish face and bright eyes which had so often
looked up to mine in the days when the heir of the Abbey was one of
the most juvenile scholars at Eton.

The lady seated nearest Edward Chrighton attracted my chief attention;
for I felt sure that this lady was Miss Tremaine. She was tall and
slim, and carried her head and neck with a stately air, which struck
me more than anything in that first glance. Yes, she was handsome,
undeniably handsome; and my cousin had been right when she said I
could not fail to admire her; but to me the dazzlingly fair face with
its perfect features, the marked aquiline nose, the short upper lip
expressive of unmitigated pride, the full cold blue eyes, pencilled
brows, and aureole of pale golden hair, were the very reverse of
sympathetic. That Miss Tremaine must needs be universally admired, it
was impossible to doubt; but I could not understand how any man could
fall in love with such a woman.

She was dressed in white muslin, and her only ornament was a superb
diamond locket, heart-shaped, tied round her long white throat with a
broad black ribbon. Her hair, of which she seemed to have a great
quantity, was arranged in a massive coronet of plaits, which
surmounted the small head as proudly as an imperial crown.

To this young lady Mrs Chrighton introduced me.

'I have another cousin to present to you, Julia,' she said smiling--
'Miss Sarah Chrighton, just arrived from St Petersburg.'

'From St Petersburg? What an awful journey! How do you do, Miss
Chrighton? It was really very courageous of you to come so far. Did
you travel alone?'

'No; I had a companion as far as London, and a very kind one. I came
on to the Abbey by myself.'

The young lady had given me her hand with rather a languid air, I
thought. I saw the cold blue eyes surveying me curiously from head to
foot, and it seemed to me as if I could read the condemnatory summing-
up--'A frump, and a poor relation'--in Miss Tremaine's face.

I had not much time to think about her just now; for Edward Chrighton
suddenly seized both my hands, and gave me so hearty and loving a
welcome, that he almost brought the tears 'up from my heart into my
eyes'.

Two pretty girls in blue crape came running forward from different
parts of the room, and gaily saluted me as 'Cousin Sarah'; and the
three surrounded me in a little cluster, and assailed me with a string
of questions--whether I remembered this, and whether I had forgotten
duo, the battle in the hay-field, the charity-school tea-party in the
vicarage orchard, our picnics in Hawsley Combe, our botanical and
entomological excursions on Chorwell-common, and all the simple
pleasures of their childhood and my youth. While this catechism was
going on, Miss Tremaine watched us with a disdainful expression, which
she evidently did not care to hide.

'I should not have thought you capable of such Arcadian simplicity, Mr
Chrighton,' she said at last. 'Pray continue your recollections. These
juvenile experiences are most interesting.'

'I don't expect you to be interested in them, Julia,' Edward answered,
with a tone that sounded rather too bitter for a lover. 'I know what a
contempt you have for trifling rustic pleasures. Were you ever a child
yourself, I wonder, by the way? I don't believe you ever ran after a
butterfly in your life.'

Her speech put an end to our talk of the past, somehow. I saw that
Edward was vexed, and that all the pleasant memories of his boyhood
had fled before that cold scornful face. A young lady in pink, who had
been sitting next Julia Tremaine, vacated the sofa, and Edward slipped
into her place, and devoted himself for the rest of the evening to his
betrothed. I glanced at his bright, expressive face now and then as he
talked to her, and could not help wondering what charm he could
discover in one who seemed to me so unworthy of him.

It was midnight when I went back to my room in the north wing,
thoroughly happy in the cordial welcome that had been given me. I rose
early next morning--for early rising had long been habitual to me--
and, drawing back the damask-curtain that sheltered my window, looked
out at the scene below.

I saw a stable-yard, a spacious quadrangle, surrounded by the closed
doors of stables and dog-kennels: low massive buildings of grey stone,
with the ivy creeping over them here and there, and with an ancient
moss-grown look, that gave them a weird kind of interest in my eyes.
this range of stabling must have been disused for a long time, I
fancied. The stables now in use were a pile of handsome red-brick
buildings at the other extremity of the house, to the rear of the
music-room, and forming a striking feature in the back view of the
Abbey.

I had often heard how the present Squire's grandfather had kept a pack
of hounds, which had been sold immediately after his death; and I knew
that my cousin, the present Mr Chrighton, had been more than once
requested to follow his ancestor's good example; for there were no
hounds now within twenty miles of the Abbey, though it was a fine
country for fox-hunting.

George Chrighton, however--the reigning lord of the Abbey--was not a
hunting man. He had, indeed, a secret horror of the sport; for more
than one scion of the house had perished untimely in the hunting-
field, The family had not been altogether a lucky one, in spite of its
wealth and prosperity. It was not often that the goodly heritage had
descended to the eldest son. Death in some form or other--on too many
occasions a violent death--had come between the heir and his
inheritance. And when I pondered on the dark pages in the story of the
house, I used to wonder whether my cousin Fanny was ever troubled by
morbid forebodings about her only and fondly loved son, Was there a
ghost at Chrighton--that spectral visitant without which the state and
splendour of a grand old house seem scarcely complete? Yes, I had
heard vague hints of some shadowy presence that had been seen on rare
occasions within the precincts of the Abbey; but I had never been able
to ascertain what shape it bore.

Those whom I questioned were prompt to assure me that they had seen
nothing. They had heard stories of the past--foolish legends, most
likely, not worth listening to. Once, when I had spoken of the subject
to my cousin George, he told me angrily never again to let him hear
any allusion to that folly from my lips.

That December passed merrily. The old house was full of really
pleasant people, and the brief winter days were spent in one unbroken
round of amusement and gaiety. To me the old familiar English country-
house life was a perpetual delight--to feel myself amongst kindred an
unceasing pleasure. I could not have believed myself capable of being
so completely happy.

I saw a great deal of my cousin Edward, and I think he contrived to
make Miss Tremaine understand that, to please him, she must be
gracious to me. She certainly took some pains to make herself
agreeable to me; and I discovered that, in spite of that proud
disdainful temper, which she so rarely took the trouble to conceal,
she was really anxious to gratify her lover.

Their courtship was not altogether a halcyon period. They had frequent
quarrels, the details of which Edward's sisters Sophy and Agnes
delighted to discuss with me. It was the struggle of two proud spirits
for mastery; but my cousin Edward's pride was of the nobler kind--the
lofty scorn of all things mean--a pride that does not ill-become a
generous nature. To me he seemed all that was admirable, and I was
never tired of hearing his mother praise him. I think my cousin Fanny
knew this, and that she used to confide in me as fully as if I had
been her sister.

'I daresay you can see I am not quite so fond as I should wish to be
of Julia Tremaine,' she said to me one day; 'but I am very glad that
my son is going to marry. My husband's has not been a fortunate
family, you know, Sarah. The eldest sons have been wild and unlucky
for generations past; and when Edward was a boy I used to have many a
bitter hour, dreading what the future might bring forth. Thank God he
has been, and is, all that I can wish. He has never given me an hour's
anxiety by any act of his. Yet I am not the less glad of his marriage.
The heirs of Chrighton who have come to an untimely end have all died
unmarried. There was Hugh Chrighton, in the reign of George the
Second, who was killed in a duel; John, who broke his back in the
hunting-field thirty years later; Theodore, shot accidentally by a
schoolfellow at Eton; Jasper, whose yacht went down in the
Mediterranean forty years ago. An awful list, is it not, Sarah? I
shall fret as if my son were safer somehow when he is married. It will
seem as if he has escaped the ban that has fallen on so many of our
house. He will have greater reason to be careful of his life when he
is a married man.'

I agreed with Mrs Chrighton; but could not help wishing that Edward
had chosen any other woman than the cold handsome Julia. I could not
fancy his future life happy with such a mate.

Christmas came by and by--a real old English Christmas--frost and snow
without, warmth and revelry within; skating on the great pond in the
park, and sledging on the ice-bound high-roads, by day; private
theatricals, charades, and amateur concerts, by night. I was surprised
to find that Miss Tremaine refused to take any active part in these
evening amusements. She preferred to sit among the elders as a
spectator, and had the air and bearing of a princess for whose
diversion all our entertainments had been planned. She seemed to think
that she fulfilled her mission by sitting still and looking handsome.
No desire to show off appeared to enter her mind. Her intense pride
left no room for vanity. Yet I knew that she could have distinguished
herself as a musician if she had chosen to do so; for I had heard her
sing and play in Mrs Chrighton's morning-room, when only Edward, his
sisters, and myself were present; and I knew that both as a vocalist
and a pianist she excelled all our guests.

The two girls and I had many a happy morning and afternoon, going from
cottage to cottage in a pony-carriage laden with Mrs Chrighton's gifts
to the poor of her parish. There was no public formal distribution of
blanketing and coals, but the wants of all were amply provided for in
a quiet friendly way. Agnes and Sophy, aided by an indefatigable maid,
the Rector's daughter, and one or two other young ladies, had been at
work for the last three months making smart warm frocks and useful
under-garments for the children of the cottagers; so that on Christmas
morning every child in the parish was arrayed in a complete set of new
garments. Mrs Chrighton had an admirable faculty of knowing precisely
what was most wanted in every household; and our pony-carriage used to
convey a varied collection of goods, every parcel directed in the firm
free hand of the chatelaine of the Abbey.

Edward used sometimes to drive us on these expeditions, and I found
that he was eminently popular among the poor of Chrighton parish. He
had such an airy pleasant way of talking to them, a manner which set
them at their ease at once. He never forgot their names or
relationships, or wants or ailments; had a packet of exactly the kind
of tobacco each man liked best always ready in his coat-pockets; and
was full of jokes, which may not have been particularly witty, but
which used to make the small low-roofed chambers ring with hearty
laughter.

Miss Tremaine coolly declined any share in these pleasant duties.

'I don't like poor people,' she said. I daresay it sounds very
dreadful, but it's just as well to confess my iniquity at once. I
never can get on with them, or they with me. I am not simpatica, I
suppose. And then I cannot endure their stifling rooms. The close faint
odour of their houses gives me a fever. And again, what is the use of
visiting them? It is only an inducement to them to become hypocrites.
Surely it is better to arrange on a sheet of paper what it is just and
fair for them in have--blankets, and coals, and groceries, and money,
and wine, and so on--and let them receive the things from some
trustworthy servant. In that case, there need be no cringing on one
side, and no endurance in the other.'

'But, you see, Julia, there are some kinds of people to whom that sort
of thing is not a question of endurance,' Edward answered, his face
flushing indignantly. 'People who like to share in the pleasure they
give--who like to see the poor careworn faces lighted up with sudden
joy--who like to make these sons of the soil feel that there is some
friendly link between themselves and their masters--some point of
union between the cottage and the great house. There is my mother, for
instance: all these duties which you think so tiresome are to her an
unfailing delight. There will be a change, I'm afraid, Julia, when you
are mistress of the Abbey.'

'You have not made me that yet,' she answered; 'and there is plenty of
time for you to change your mind, if you do not think me suited for
the position. I do not pretend to be like your mother.

It is better that I should no affect any feminine virtues which I do
not possess.'

After this Edward insisted on driving our pony-carriage almost every
day, leaving Miss Tremaine to find her own amusement; and I think this
conversation was the beginning of an estrangement between them, which
became more serious than any of their previous quarrels had been.

Miss Tremaine did not care for sledging, or skating, or billiard-
playing. She had none of the 'fast' tendencies which have become so
common lately. She used to sit in one particular bow-window of the
drawing-room all the morning, working a screen in berlin-wool and
beads, assisted and attended by her younger sister Laura, who was a
kind of slave to her--a very colourless young lady in mind, capable of
no such thing as an original opinion, and in person a pale replica of
her sister.

Had there been less company in the house, the breach between Edward
Chrighton and his betrothed must have become notorious; but with a
house so full of people, all bent on enjoying themselves, I doubt if
it was noticed. On all public occasions my cousin showed himself
attentive and apparently devoted to Miss Tremaine. It was only I and
his sisters who knew the real state of affairs.

I was surprised, after the young lady's total repudiation of all
benevolent sentiments, when she beckoned me aside one morning, and
slipped a little purse of gold--twenty sovereigns--into my hand.

'I shall be very much obliged if you will distribute that among your
cottagers today, Miss Chrighton,' she said. 'Of course I should like
to give them something; it's only the trouble of talking to them that
I shrink from; and you are just the person for an almoner. Don't
mention my little commission to any one, please.'

'Of course I may tell Edward,' I said; for I was anxious that he
should know his betrothed was not as hard-hearted as she had appeared.

'To him least of all,' she answered eagerly. 'You know that our ideas
vary on that point, he would think I gave the money to please him. Not
a word, pray, Miss Chrighton.' I submitted, and distributed my
sovereigns quietly, with the most careful exercise of my judgement.

So Christmas came and passed. It was the day after the great
anniversary--a very quiet day for the guests and family at the Abbey,
but a grand occasion for the servants, who were to have their annual
ball in the evening--a ball to which all the humbler class of tenantry
were invited. The frost had broken up suddenly, and it was a thorough
wet day--a depressing kind of day for any one whose spirits are liable
to be affected by the weather, as mine are. I felt out of spirits for
the first time since my arrival at the Abbey.

No one else appeared to feel the same influence. The elder ladies sat
in a wide semicircle round one of the fireplaces in the drawing-room;
a group of merry girls and dashing young men chatted gaily before the
other. From the billiard-room there came the frequent clash of balls,
and cheery peals of stentorian laughter. I sat in one of the deep
windows, half hidden by the curtains, reading a novel--one of a boxful
that came from town every month.

If the picture within was bright and cheerful, the prospect was dreary
enough without. The fairy forest of snow-wreathed trees, the white
valleys and undulating banks of snow, had vanished, and the rain
dripped slowly and sullenly upon a darksome expanse of sodden grass,
and a dismal background of leafless timber. The merry sound of the
sledge-bells no longer enlivened the air; all was silence and gloom.

Edward Chrighton was not amongst the billiard-players; he was pacing
the drawing-room to and fro from end to end, with an air that was at
once moody and restless.

'Thank heaven, the frost has broken up at last!' he exclaimed,
stopping in front of the window where I sat.

He had spoken to himself, quite unaware of my close neighbourhood.
Unpromising as his aspect was just then, I ventured to accost him.

'What bad taste, to prefer such weather as this to frost and snow!' I
answered. 'The park looked enchanting yesterday--a real scene from
fairyland. And only look at it today!'

'O yes, of course, from an artistic point of view, the snow was
better. The place does look something like the great dismal swamp
today; but I am thinking of hunting, and that confounded frost made a
day's sport impossible. We are in for a spell of mild weather now, I
think.'

'But you are not going to hunt, are you, Edward?'

'Indeed I am, my gentle cousin, in spite of that frightened look in
your amiable countenance.'

'I thought there were no hounds hereabouts.'

'Nor are there; but there is as fine a pack as any in the country--the
Daleborough hounds---five-and-twenty miles away.'

'And you are going five-and-twenty miles for the sake of a day's run?'

'I would travel forty, fifty, a hundred miles for that same diversion.
But I am not going for a single day this time; I am going over to Sir
Francis Wycherly's place--young Frank Wycherly and I were sworn chums
at Christchurch--for three or four days. I am due today, but I
scarcely dared to travel by cross-country roads in such rain as this.
However, if the floodgates of the sky are loosened for a new deluge, I
must go tomorrow.'

'What a headstrong young man!' I exclaimed. 'And what will Miss
Tremaine say to this desertion?' I asked in a lower voice.

'Miss Tremaine can say whatever she pleases. She had it in her power
to make me forget the pleasures of the chase, if she had chosen,
though we had been in the heart of the shires, and the welkin ringing
with the baying of hounds.'

'O, I begin to understand. This hunting engagement is not of long
standing.'

'No; I began to find myself bored here a few days ago, and wrote to
Frank to offer myself for two or three days at Wycherly. I received a
most cordial answer by return, and am booked till the end of this
week.'

'You have not forgotten the ball on the first?'

'Oh, no; to do that would be to vex my mother, and to offer a slight to
our guests. I shall be here for the first, come what may.'

Come what may! so lightly spoken. The time came when I had bitter
occasion to remember those words.

'I'm afraid you will vex your mother by going at all,' I said. 'You
know what a horror both she and your father have of hunting.'

'A most un-country-gentleman-like aversion on my father's part. But he
is a dear old book-worm, seldom happy out of his library. Yes, I admit
they both have a dislike to hunting in the abstract; but they know I
am a pretty good rider, and that it would need a bigger country than I
shall find about Wycherly to floor me. You need not feel nervous, my
dear Sarah; I am not going to give papa and mamma the smallest ground
for uneasiness.'

'You will take your own horses, I suppose?'

'That goes without saying. No man who has cattle of his own cares to
mount another man's horses. I shall take Pepperbox and the Druid.'

'Pepperbox has a queer temper, I have heard your sisters say.'

'My sisters expect a horse to be a kind of overgrown baa-lamb.
Everything splendid in horseflesh and womankind is prone to that
slight defect, an ugly temper. There is Miss Tremaine, for instance.'

'I shall take Miss Tremaine's part. I believe it is you who are in the
wrong in the matter of this estrangement, Edward.'

'Do you? Well, wrong or right, my cousin, until the fair Julia comes
to me with sweet looks and gentle words, we can never be what we have
been.'

'You will return from your hunting expedition in a softer mood,' I
answered; 'that is to say, if you persist in going. But I hope and
believe you will change your mind.'

'Such a change is not within the limits of possibility, Sarah. I am
fixed as Fate.'

He strolled away, humming some gay hunting-song as he went. I was
alone with Mrs Chrighton later in the afternoon, and she spoke to me
about this intended visit to Wycherly.

'Edward has set his heart upon it evidently,' she said regretfully,
and his father and I have always made a point of avoiding anything
that could seem like domestic tyranny. Our dear boy is such a good
son, that it would be very hard if we came between him and his
pleasures. You know what a morbid horror my husband has of the dangers
of the hunting-field, and perhaps I am almost as weak-minded. But in
spite of this we have never interfered with Edward's enjoyment of a
sport which he is passionately fond of; and hitherto, thank God! he
has escaped without a scratch. Yet I have had many a bitter hour, I
can assure you, my dear, when my son has been away in Leicestershire
hunting four days a week.'

'He rides well, I suppose.'

'Superbly. He has a great reputation among the sportsmen of our
neighbourhood. I daresay when he is master of the Abbey he will start
a pack of hounds, and revive the old days of his great-grandfather,
Meredith Chrighton.'

'I fancy the hounds were kenneled in the stable-yard below my bedroom
window in those days, were they not, Fanny?'

'Yes,' Mrs Chrighton answered gravely; and I wondered at the sudden
shadow that fell upon her face.

I went up to my room earlier than usual that afternoon, and I had
clear hour to spare before it would be time to dress for the seven
o'clock dinner. This leisure hour I intended to devote to letter-
writing; but on arriving in my room I found myself in a very idle
frame of mind; and instead of opening my desk, I seated myself in the
low easy-chair before the fire, and fell into a reverie.

How long I had been sitting there I scarcely know; I had been half
meditating, half dozing, mixing broken snatches of thought with brief
glimpses of dreaming, when I was startled into wakefulness by a sound
that was strange to me.

It was a huntsman's horn--a few low plaintive notes on a huntsman's
horn--notes which had a strange far-away sound, that was more
unearthly than anything my ears had ever heard. I thought of the music
in Der Freischutz; but the weirdest snatch of melody Weber ever wrote
was not so ghastly a sound as these few simple notes conveyed to my
ear.

I stood transfixed, listening to that awful music. It had grown dusk,
my fire was almost out, and the room in shadow. As I listened, a light
flashed suddenly on the wall before me. The light was as unearthly as
the sound--a light that never shone from earth or sky.

I ran to the window; for this ghastly shimmer flashed through the
window upon the opposite wall. The great gates of the stable-yard were
open, and men in scarlet coats were riding in, a pack of hounds
crowding in before them, obedient to the huntsman's whip. The whole
scene was dimly visible by the declining light of the winter evening
and the weird gleams of a lantern carried by one of the men. It was
this lantern which had shone upon the tapestried wall. I saw the
stable-doors opened one after another; gentlemen and grooms alighting
from their horses; the dogs driven into their kennel; the helpers
hurrying to and fro; and that strange wan lantern-light glimmering
here and there in the gathering dusk. But there was no sound of
horse's hoof or of human voices--not one yelp or cry from the hounds.
Since those faint far-away sounds of the horn had died out in the
distance, the ghastly silence had been unbroken.

I stood at my window quite calmly, and watched while the group of men
and animals in the yard below noiselessly dispersed. There was nothing
supernatural in the manner of their disappearance. The figures did not
vanish or melt into empty air. One by one I saw the horses led into
their separate quarters; one by one the redcoats strolled out of the
gates, and the grooms departed, some one way, some another. The scene,
but for its noiselessness, was natural enough; and had I been a
stranger in the house, I might have fancied that those figures were
real--those stables in full occupation.

But I knew that stable-yard and all its range of building to have been
disused for more than half a century. Could I believe that, without an
hour's warning, the long-deserted quadrangle could be filled--the
empty stalls tenanted? Had some hunting-party from the neighbourhood
sought shelter here, glad to escape the pitiless rain? That was not
impossible, I thought. I was an utter unbeliever in all ghostly
things--ready to credit any possibility rather than suppose that I had
been looking upon shadows. And yet the noiselessness, the awful sound
of that horn--the strange unearthly gleam of that lantern! Little
superstitious as I might be, a cold sweat stood out upon my forehead,
and I trembled in every limb.

For some minutes I stood by the window, statue-like, staring blankly
into the empty quadrangle. Then I roused myself suddenly, and ran
softly downstairs by a back staircase leading to the servants'
quarters, determined to solve the mystery somehow or other. The way to
Mrs Marjorum's room was familiar to me from old experience, and it was
thither that I bent my steps, determined to ask the housekeeper the
meaning of what I had seen. I had a lurking conviction that it would
be well for me not to mention that scene to any member of the family
till I had taken counsel with some one who knew the secrets of
Chrighton Abbey.

I heard the sound of merry voices and laughter as I passed the kitchen
and servants' hall. Men and maids were all busy in the pleasant labour
of decorating their rooms for the evening's festival. They were
putting the last touches to garlands of holly and laurel, ivy and fir,
as I passed the open doors; and in both rooms I saw tables laid for a
substantial tea. The housekeeper's room was in a retired nook at the
end of a long passage--a charming old room, panelled with dark oak,
and full of capacious cupboards, which in my childhood I had looked
upon as storehouses of inexhaustible treasures in the way of preserves
and other confectionery. It was a shady old room, with a wide old-
fashioned fireplace, cool in summer, when the hearth was adorned with
a great jar of roses and lavender; and warm in winter, when the logs
burnt merrily all day long.

I opened the door sofly; and went in. Mrs Marjorum was dozing in a
high-backed arm-chair by the glowing hearth, dressed in her state gown
of grey watered silk, and with a cap that was a perfect garden of
roses. She opened her eyes as I approached her, and stared at me with
a puzzled look for the first moment or so.

'Why, is that you, Miss Sarah?' she exclaimed; 'and looking as pale as
a ghost, I can see, even by this firelight! Let me just light a
candle, toil then I'll get you some sal volatile. Sit down in my
armchair, miss; why, I declare you're all of a tremble!'

She put me into her easy-chair before I could resist, and lighted the
two candles which stood ready upon her table, while I was trying to
speak. My lips were dry, and it seemed at first as if my voice was
gone.

'Never mind the sal volatile, Marjorum,' I said at last. 'I am not
ill; I've been startled, that's all; and I've come to ask you for an
explanation of the business that frightened me.'

'What business, Miss Sarah?'

'You must have heard something of it yourself, surely. Didn't you hear
a horn just now, a huntsman's horn?'

'A horn! Lord no, Miss Sarah. What ever could have put such a fancy in
to your head?'

I saw that Mrs Marjorum's ruddy cheeks had suddenly lost their colour,
that she was now almost as pale as I could have been myself. 'It was
no fancy,' I said; 'I heard the sound, and saw the people. A hunting-
party has just taken shelter in the north quadrangle. Dogs and horses,
and gentlemen and servants.'

'What were they like, Miss Sarah?' the housekeeper asked in a strange
voice.

'I can hardly tell you that. I could see that they wore red coats; and
I could scarcely see more than that. Yes, I did get a glimpse of one
of the gentlemen by the light of the lantern. A tall man, with grey
hair and whiskers, and a stoop in his shoulders. I noticed that he
wore a short-waisted coat with a very high collar--a coat that looked
a hundred years old.'

'The old Squire!' muttered Mrs Marjorum under her breath; and then
turning to me, she said with a cheery resolute air, 'You've been
dreaming, Miss Sarah, that's just what it is. You've dropped off in
your chair before the fire, and had a dream, that's it.'

'No, Marjorum, it was no dream. The horn woke me, and I stood at my
window and saw the dogs and huntsmen come in.'

'Do you know, Miss Sarah, that the gates of the north quadrangle have
been locked and barred for the last forty years, and that no one ever
goes in there except through the house?'

'The gates may have been opened this evening to give shelter to
strangers,' I said.

'Not when the only keys that will open them hang yonder in my
cupboard, miss,' said the housekeeper, pointing to a corner of the
room.

'But I tell you, Marjorum, these people came into the quadrangle; the
horses and dogs are in the stables and kennels at this moment. I'll go
and ask Mr Chrighton, or my cousin Fanny, or Edward, all about it,
since you won't tell me the truth.'

I said this with a purpose, and it answered. Mrs Marjorum caught me
eagerly by the wrist.

'No, miss, don't do that; for pity's sake don't do that; don't breathe
a word to missus or master.'

'But why not?'

'Because you've seen that which always brings misfortune and sorrow to
this house, Miss Sarah. You've seen the dead.'

'What do you mean?' I gasped, awed in spite of myself.

'I daresay you've heard say that there's been something seen at times
at the Abbey--many years apart, thank God; for it never came that
trouble didn't come after it.'

'Yes,' I answered hurriedly; 'but I could never get any one to tell me
what it was that haunted this place.'

'No, miss. Those that know have kept the secret. But you have seen it
all tonight. There's no use in trying to hide it from you any longer.
You have seen the old Squire, Meredith Chrighton, whose eldest son was
killed by a fall in the hunting-field, brought home dead one December
night, an hour after his father and the rest of the party had come
safe home to the Abbey. The old gentleman had missed his son in the
field, but had thought nothing of that, fancying that master John had
had enough of the day's sport, and had turned his horse's head
homewards. He was found by a labouring-man, poor lad, lying in a ditch
with his back broken, and his horse beside him staked. The old Squire
never held his head up after that day, and never rode to hounds again,
though he was passionately fond of hunting. Dogs and horses were sold,
and the north quadrangle has been empty from that day.'

'How long is it since this kind of thing has been seen?'

'A long time, miss. I was a slip of a girl when it last happened. It
was in the winter-time--this very night--the night Squire Meredith's
son was killed; and the house was full of company, just as it is now.
There was a wild young Oxford gentleman sleeping in your room at that
time, and he saw the hunting-party come into the quadrangle; and what
did he do but throw his window wide open, and give them the view-hallo
as loud as ever he could. He had only arrived the day before, and knew
nothing about the neighbourhood; so at dinner he began to ask where
were his friends the sportsmen, and to hope he should be allowed to
have a run with the Abbey hounds next day. It was in the time of our
master's father; and his lady at the head of the table turned as white
as a sheet when she heard this talk. She had good reason, poor soul.
Before the week was out her husband was lying dead. He was struck with
a fit of apoplexy, and never spoke or knew any one afterwards.'

'An awful coincidence,' I said; 'but it may have been only a
coincidence.'

'I've heard other stories, miss--heard them from those that wouldn't
deceive--all proving the same thing: that the appearance of the old
Squire and his pack is a warning of death to this house.'

'I cannot believe these things,' I exclaimed; 'I cannot believe them.
Docs Mr Edward know anything about this?'

'No, miss. His father and mother have been most careful that it should
be kept from him.'

'I think he is too strong-minded to be much affected by the fact,' I
said.

'And you'll not say anything about what you've seen to my master or my
mistress, will you, Miss Sarah?' pleaded the faithful old servant.
'The knowledge of it would be sure to make them nervous and unhappy.
And if evil is to come upon this house, it isn't in human power to
prevent its coming.'

'God forbid that there is any evil at hand!' I answered. 'I am no
believer in visions or omens.

After all, I would sooner fancy that I was dreaming--dreaming with my
eyes open as I stood at the window--than that I beheld the shadows of
the dead.'

Mrs Marjorum sighed, and said nothing. I could see that she believed
firmly in the phantom hunt.

I went back to my room to dress for dinner. However rationally I might
try to think of what I had seen, its effect upon my mind and nerves
was not the less powerful. I could think of nothing else; and a
strange morbid dread of coming misery weighted me down like an actual
burden.

There was a very cheerful party in the drawing-room when I went
downstairs, and at dinner the talk and laughter were unceasing; but I
could see that my cousin Fanny's face was a little graver than usual,
and I had no doubt she was thinking of her son's intended visit to
Wycherly.

At the thought of this a sudden terror flashed upon me. How if the
shadows I had seen that evening were ominous of danger to him--to
Edward, the heir and only son of the house? My heart grew cold as I
thought of this, and yet in the next moment I despised myself for such
weakness.

'It is natural enough for an old servant to believe in such things,' I
said to myself; 'but for me--an educated woman of the world--
preposterous folly.'

And yet from that moment I began to puzzle myself in the endeavour to
devise some means by which Edward's journey might be prevented. Of my
own influence I knew that I was powerless to hinder his departure by
so much as an hour; but I fancied that Julia Tremaine could persuade
him to any sacrifice of his inclination, if she could only humble her
pride so far as to entreat it. I determined to appeal to her in the
course of the evening.

We were very merry all that evening. The servants and their guests
danced in the great hall, while we sat in the gallery above, and in
little groups upon the staircase, watching their diversions. I think
this arrangement afforded excellent opportunities for flirtation, and
that the younger members of our party made good use of their chances--
with one exception: Edward Chrighton and his affianced contrived to
keep far away from each other all the evening.

While all was going on noisily in the hall below, I managed to get
Miss Tremaine apart from the others in the embrasure of a painted
window on the stairs, where there was a wide oaken seat.

Seated here side by side, I described to her, under a promise of
secrecy, the scene which I had witnessed that afternoon, and my
conversation with Mrs Marjorum.

'But, good gracious me, Miss Chrighton!' the young lady exclaimed,
lifting her pencilled eyebrows with unconcealed disdain, 'you don't
mean to tell me that you believe in such nonsense--ghosts and omens,
and old woman's folly like that!'

'I assure you, Miss Tremaine, it is most difficult for me to believe
in the supernatural,' I answered earnestly; 'but that which I saw this
evening was something more than human. The thought of it has made me
very unhappy; and I cannot help connecting it somehow with my cousin
Edward's visit to Wycherly. If I had the power to prevent his going, I
would do it at any cost; but I have not. You alone have influence
enough for that. For heaven's sake use it! do anything to hinder his
hunting with the Daleborough hounds.'

'You would have me humiliate myself by asking him to forgo his
pleasure, and that after his conduct to me during the last week?'

'I confess that he has done much to offend you. But you love him, Miss
Tremaine, though you are too proud to let your love be seen: I am
certain that you do love him. For pity's sake speak to him; do not let
him hazard his life, when a few words from you may prevent the
danger.'

'I don't believe he would give up this visit to please me,' she
answered; 'and I shall certainly not put it in his power to humiliate
me I a refusal. Besides, all this fear of yours is such utter
nonsense. As if nobody had ever hunted before. My brothers hunt four
times a week every winter, and not one of them has ever been the worse
for it.

I did not give up the attempt lightly. I pleaded with this proud
obstinate girl for a long time, as long as I could induce her to
listen to me; but it was all in vain. She stuck to her text--no one
should persuade her to degrade herself by asking a favour of Edward
Chrighton. He had chosen to hold himself aloof from her, and she would
show him that she could live without him. When she left Chrighton
Abbey, they would part as strangers.

So the night closed, and at breakfast next morning I heard that Edward
had started for Wycherly soon after daybreak. His absence made, for me
at least, a sad blank in our circle. For one other also, I think; for
Miss Tremaine's fair proud face was very pale, though she tried to
seem gayer than usual, and exerted herself in quite an unaccustomed
manner in her endeavour to be agreeable to everyone.

The days passed slowly for me after my cousin's departure. There was a
weight upon my mind, a vague anxiety, which I struggled in vain Cu
shake off. The house, full as it was of pleasant people, seemed to me
to have become dull and dreary now that Edward was gone. The place
where he had sat appeared always vacant to my eyes, though another
filled it, and there was no gap on either side of the long dinner-
table. Lighthearted young men still made the billiard-room resonant
with their laughter; merry girls flirted as gaily as ever, undisturbed
in the smallest degree by the absence of the heir of the house. Yet
for me all was changed. A morbid fancy had taken complete possession
of me. I found myself continually brooding over the housekeeper's
words; those words which had told me that the shadows I had seen boded
death and sorrow to the house of Chrighton.

My cousins, Sophy and Agnes, were no more concerned about their
brother's welfare than were their guests. They were full of excitement
about the New-Year's ball, which was to be a very grand affair. Everyone
 of importance within fifty miles was to be present, every nook and
corner of the Abbey would be filled with visitors coming from a great
distance, while others were to be billeted upon the better class of
tenantry round about. Altogether the organization of this affair was
no small business; and Mrs Chrighton's mornings were broken by
discussions with the housekeeper, messages from the cook, interviews
with the head-gardener on the subject of floral decorations, and other
details, which all alike demanded the attention of the chatelaine
herself. With these duties, and with the claims of her numerous
guests, my cousin Fanny's time was so fully occupied, that she had
little leisure to indulge in anxious feelings about her son, whatever
secret uneasiness may have been lurking in her maternal heart. As for
the master of the Abbey, he spent so much of his time in the library,
where, under the pretext of business with his bailiff, he read Greek,
that it was not easy for any one to discover what he did feel. Once,
and once only, I heard him speak of his son, in a tone that betrayed
an intense eagerness for his return.

The girls were to have new dresses from a French milliner in Wigmore
Street; and as the great event drew near, bulky packages of millinery
were continually arriving, and feminine consultations and expositions
of finery were being held all day long in bedrooms and dressing-rooms
with closed doors. Thus, with a mind always troubled by the same dark
shapeless foreboding, I was perpetually being called upon to give an
opinion about pink tulle and lilies of the valley, or maize silk and
apple-blossoms.

New-Year's morning came at last, after an interval of abnormal length,
as it seemed to me. It was a bright clear day, an almost spring-like
sunshine lighting up the leafless landscape. The great dining-room was
noisy with congratulations and good wishes as we assembled for
breakfast on this first morning of a new year, after having seen the
old one out cheerily the night before; but Edward had not yet
returned, and I missed him sadly. Some touch of sympathy drew me to
the side of Julia Tremaine on this particular morning. I had watched
her very often during the last few days, and I had seen that her cheek
grew paler every day. Today her eyes had the dull heavy look that
betokens a sleepless night. Yes, I was sure that she was unhappy--that
the proud relentless nature suffered bitterly.

'He must be home today,' I said to her in a low voice, as she sat in
stately silence before an untasted breakfast.

'Who must?' she answered, turning towards me with a cold distant
look.

'My cousin Edward. You know he promised to be back in time for the
ball.'

'I know nothing of Mr Chrighton's intended movements.' she said in her
haughtiest tone; 'but of course it is only natural that he should be
here tonight. He would scarcely care to insult half the county by his
absence, however little he may value those now staying in his father's
house.'

'But you know that there is one here whom he does value better than
any one else in the world, Miss Tremaine,' I answered, anxious to
soothe this proud girl.

'I know nothing of the kind. But why do you speak so solemnly about
his return? He will come, of course. There is no reason he should not
come.'

She spoke in a rapid manner that was strange to her, and looked at me
with a sharp enquiring glance, that touched me somehow, it was so
unlike herself--it revealed to me so keen an anxiety.

'No, there is no reasonable cause for anything like uneasiness,' I
said; 'but you remember what I told you the other night. That has
preyed upon my mind, and it will be an unspeakable relief to me when I
see my cousin safe at home.'

'I am sorry that you should indulge in such weakness, Miss Chrighton.'

That was all she said; but when I saw her in the drawing-room after
breakfast, she had established herself in a window that commanded a
view of the long winding drive leading to the front of the Abbey. From
this point she could not fail to see any one approaching the house. She
sat there all day; everyone else was more or less busy with
arrangements for the evening, or at any rate occupied with an
appearance of business; but Julia Tremaine kept her place by the
window, pleading a headache as an excuse for sitting still, with a
book in her hand, all day, yet obstinately refusing to go to her room
and lie down, when her mother entreated her to do so.

'You will be fit for nothing tonight, Julia,' Mrs Tremaine said,
almost angrily; 'you have been looking ill for ever so long, and today
you are as pale as a ghost.'

I knew that she was watching for him; and I pitied her with all my
heart, as the day wore itself out, and he did not come.

We dined earlier than usual, played a game or two of billiards after
dinner, made a tour of inspection through the bright rooms, lit with
wax-candles only, and odorous with exoties; and then came a long
interregnum devoted to the arts and mysteries of the toilet; while
maids flitted to and fro laden with frilled muslin petticoats from the
laundry, and a faint smell of singed hair pervaded the corridors. At
ten o'clock the band were tuning their violins, and pretty girls and
elegant-looking men were coming slowly down the broad oak staircase,
as the roll of fast-coming wheels sounded louder without, and
stentorian voices announced the best people in the county.

I have no need to dwell long upon the details of that evening's
festival. It was very much like other balls--a brilliant success, a
night of splendour and enchantment for those whose hearts were light
and happy, and who could abandon themselves utterly to the pleasure of
the moment; a far-away picture of fair faces and bright-hued dresses,
a wearisome kaleidoscopic procession of form and colour for those
whose minds were weighed down with the burden of a hidden care.

For me the music had no melody, the dazzling scene no charm. Hour
after hour went by; supper was over, and the waltzers were enjoying
those latest dances which always seem the most delightful, and yet
Edward Chrighton had not appeared amongst us.

There had been innumerable enquiries about him, and Mrs Chrighton had
apologized for his absence as best she might. Poor soul, I well knew
that his non-return was now a source of poignant anxiety to her,
although she greeted all her guests with the same gracious smile, and
was able to talk gaily and well upon every subject. Once, when she was
sitting alone for a few minutes, watching the dancers, I saw the smile
fade from her face, and a look of anguish come over it. I ventured to
approach her at this moment, and never shall I forget the look which
she turned towards me.

'My son, Sarah!' she said in a low voice--'something has happened to
my son!'

I did my best to comfort her; but my own heart was growing heavier and
heavier, and my attempt was a very poor one.

Julia Tremaine had danced a little at the beginning of the evening, to
keep up appearances, I believe, in order that no one might suppose
that she was distressed by her lover's absence; but after the first
two or three dances she pronounced herself tired, and withdrew to a
seat amongst the matrons. She was looking very lovely in spite of her
extreme pallor, dressed in white tulle, a perfect cloud of airy
puffings, and with a wreath of ivy-leaves and diamonds crowning her
pale golden hair.

The night waned, the dancers were revolving in the last waltz, when I
happened to look towards the doorway at the end of the room. I was
startled by seeing a man standing there, with his hat in his hand, not
in evening costume; a man with a pale anxious-looking face, peering
cautiously into the room. My first thought was of evil; but in the
next moment the man had disappeared, and I saw no more of him.

I lingered by my cousin Fanny's side till the rooms were empty. Even
Sophy and Aggy had gone off to their own apartments, their airy
dresses sadly dilapidated by a night's vigorous dancing. There were
only Mr and Mrs Chrighton and myself in the long suite of rooms, where
the flowers were drooping and the wax-lights dying out one by one in
the silver sconces against the walls.

'I think the evening went off very well,' Fanny said, looking rather
anxiously at her husband, who was stretching himself and yawning with
an air of intense relief.

'Yes, the affair went off well enough. But Edward has committed a
terrible breach of manners by not being here. Upon my word, the young
men of the present day think of nothing but their own pleasures. I
suppose that something especially attractive was going on at Wycherly
today, and he couldn't tear himself away.'

'It is so unlike him to break his word,' Mrs Chrighton answered. 'You
are not alarmed, Frederick? You don't think that anything has
happened--any accident?'

'What should happen? Ned is one of the best riders in the county. I
don't think there's any fear of his coming to grief.'

'He might be ill.'

'Not he. He's a young Hercules. And if it were possible for him to he
ill--which it is not--we should have had a message from Wycherly.'

The words were scarcely spoken when Truefold the old butler stood by
his master's side, with a solemn anxious face.

'There is a--a person who wishes to see you, sir,' he said in a low
voice, 'alone.'

Low as the words were, both Fanny and myself heard them. 'Some one from
Wycherly?' she exclaimed. 'Let him come here.' 

'But, madam, the person most particularly wished to see master alone. Shall I show him into
the library, sir? The lights are not out there.'

'Then it is someone from Wycherly,' said my cousin, seizing my wrist
with a hand that was icy cold. 'Didn't I tell you so, Sarah? Something
has happened to my son. Let the person come here, Truefold, here; I
insist upon it.'

The tone of command was quite strange in a wife who was always
deferential to her husband, in a mistress who was ever gentle to her
servants.

'Let it be so, Truefold,' said Mr Chrighton. 'Whatever ill news has
come to us we will hear together.'

He put his arm round his wife's waist. Both were pale as marble, both
stood in stony stillness waiting for the blow that was to fall upon
them.

The stranger, the man I had seen in the doorway, came in. He was
curate of Wycherly church, and chaplain to Sir Francis Wycherly; a
grave middle-aged man. He told what he had to tell with all kindness,
with all the usual forms of consolation which Christianity and an
experience of sorrow could suggest. Vain words, wasted trouble. The
blow must fall, and earthly consolation was unable to lighten it by a
feather's weight.

There had been a steeplechase at Wycherly--an amateur affair with
gentlemen riders--on that bright New-Year's-day, and Edward Chrighton
had been persuaded to ride his favourite hunter Pepperbox. There would
be plenty of time for him to return to Chrighton after the races. He
had consented; and his horse was winning easily, when, at the last
fence, a double one, with water beyond, Pepperbox baulked his leap,
and went over head-foremost, flinging his rider over a hedge into a
field close beside the course, where there was a heavy stone roller.
Upon this stone roller Edward Chrighton had fallen, his head receiving
the full force of the concussion. All was told. It was while the
curate was relating the fatal catastrophe that I looked round
suddenly, and saw Julia Tremaine standing a little way behind the
speaker. She had heard all; she uttered no cry, she showed no signs of
fainting, but stood calm and motionless, waiting for the end.

I know not how that night ended: there seemed an awful calm upon us
all. A carriage was got ready, and Mr and Mrs Chrighton started for
Wycherly to look upon their dead son. He had died while they were
carrying him from the course to Sir Francis's house. I went with Julia
Tremaine to her room, and sat with her while the winter morning dawned
slowly upon us--a bitter dawning.

I have little more to tell. Life goes on, though hearts are broken.
Upon Chrighton Abbey there came a dreary time of desolation. The
master of the house lived in his library, shut from the outer world,
buried almost as completely as a hermit in his cell. I have heard that
Julia Tremaine was never known to smile after that day. She is still
unmarried, and lives entirely at her father's country house; proud and
reserved in her conduct to her equals, but a very angel of mercy and
compassion amongst the poor of the neighbourhood. Yes; this haughty
girl, who once declared herself unable to endure the hovels of the
poor, is now a Sister of Charity in all but the robe. So does a great
sorrow change the current of a woman's life.

I have seen my cousin Fanny many times since that awful New-Year's
night; for I have always the same welcome at the Abbey. I have seen
her calm and cheerful, doing her duty, smiling upon her daughter's
children, the honoured mistress of a great household; but I know that
the mainspring of life is broken, that for her there hath passed a
glory from the earth, and that upon all the pleasures and joys of this
world she looks with the solemn calm of one for whom all things are
dark with the shadow of a great sorrow.



EVELINE'S VISITANT

It was at a masked ball at the Palais Royal that my fatal quarrel with
my first cousin André de Brissac began. The quarrel was about a woman.
The women who followed the footsteps of Philip of Orleans were the
causes of many such disputes; and there was scarcely one fair head in
all that glittering throng which, to a man versed in social histories
and mysteries, might not have seemed bedabbled with blood.

I shall not record the name of her for love of whom André de Brissac
and I crossed one of the bridges, in the dim August dawn on our way to
the waste ground beyond the church of Saint-Germain des Prés.

There were many beautiful vipers in those days, and she was one of
them. I can feel the chill breath of that August morning blowing in my
face, as I sit in my dismal chamber at my château of Puy Verdun to-
night, alone in the stillness, writing the strange story of my life. I
can see the white mist rising from the river, the grim outline of the
Châtelet, and the square towers of Notre Dame black against the pale-
grey sky. Even more vividly can I recall André's fair young face, as
he stood opposite to me with his two friends--scoundrels both, and
alike eager for that unnatural fray. We were a strange group to be
seen in a summer sunrise, all of us fresh from the heat and clamour of
the Regent's saloons--André in a quaint hunting-dress copied from a
family portrait at Puy Verdun, I costumed as one of Law's Mississippi
Indians; the other men in like garish frippery, adorned with
broideries and jewels that looked wan in the pale light of dawn.

Our quarrel had been a fierce one--a quarrel which could have but one
result, and that the direst. I had struck him; and the welt raised by
my open hand was crimson upon his fair womanish face as he stood
opposite to me. The eastern sun shone on the face presently, and dyed
the cruel mark with a deeper red; but the sting of my own wrongs was
fresh, and I had not yet learned to despise myself for that brutal
outrage.

To Andre de Brissac such an insult was most terrible. He was the
favourite of Fortune, the favourite of women; and I was nothing,--a
rough soldier who had done my country good service, but in the boudoir
of a Parabère a mannerless boor.

We fought, and I wounded him mortally. Life had been very sweet for
him; and I think that a frenzy of despair took possession of him when
he felt the life-blood ebbing away. He beckoned me to him as he lay on
the ground. I went, and knelt at his side.

"Forgive me, André!" I murmured.

He took no more heed of my words than if that piteous entreaty had
been the idle ripple of the river near at hand.

"Listen to me, Hector de Brissac," he said. "I am not one who believes
that a man has done with earth because his eyes glaze and his jaw
stiffens. They will bury me in the old vault at Puy Verdun; and you
will be master of the château. Ah, I know how lightly they take things
in these days, and how Dubois will laugh when he hears that Ca has
been killed in a duel. They will bury me, and sing masses for my soul;
but you and I have not finished our affair yet, my cousin. I will be
with you when you least look to see me,--I, with this ugly scar upon
the face that women have praised and loved. I will come to you when
your life seems brightest. I will come between you and all that you
hold fairest and dearest. My ghostly hand shall drop a poison in your
cup of joy. My shadowy form shall shut the sunlight from your life.
Men with such iron will as mine can do what they please, Hector de
Brissac. It is my will to haunt you when I am dead."

All this in short broken sentences he whispered into my ear. I had
need to bend my ear close to his dying lips; but the iron will of
André de Brissac was strong enough to do battle with Death, and I
believe he said all he wished to say before his head fell back upon
the velvet cloak they had spread beneath him, never to be lifted
again.

As he lay there, you would have fancied him a fragile stripling, too
fair and frail for the struggle called life; but there are those who
remember the brief manhood of André de Brissac, and who can bear
witness to the terrible force of that proud nature.

I stood looking down at the young face with that foul mark upon it,
and God knows I was sorry for what I had done.

Of those blasphemous threats which he had whispered in my ear I took
no heed. I was a soldier, and a believer. There was nothing absolutely
dreadful to me in the thought that I had killed this man. I had killed
many men on the battlefield; and this one had done me cruel wrong.

My friends would have had me cross the frontier to escape the
consequences of my act; but I was ready to face those consequences,
and I remained in France. I kept aloof from the court, and received a
hint that I had best confine myself to my own province. Many masses
were chanted in the little chapel of Puy Verdun, for the soul of my
dead cousin, and his coffin filled a niche in the vault of our
ancestors.

His death had made me a rich man; and the thought that it was so made
my newly-acquired wealth very hateful to me. I lived a lonely
existence in the old château, where I rarely held converse with any
but the servants of the household, all of whom had served my cousin,
and none of whom liked me.

It was a hard and bitter life. It galled me, when I rode through the
village, to see the peasant-children shrink away from me. I have seen
old women cross themselves stealthily as I passed them by. Strange
reports had gone forth about me; and there were those who whispered
that I had given my soul to the Evil One as the price of my cousin's
heritage. From my boyhood I had been dark of visage and stern of
manner; and hence, perhaps, no woman's love had ever been mine. I
remembered my mother's face in all its changes of expression; but I
can remember no look of affection that ever shone on me. That other
woman, beneath whose feet I laid my heart, was pleased to accept my
homage, but she never loved me; and the end was treachery.

I had grown hateful to myself, and had well-nigh begun to hate my
fellow-creatures, when a feverish desire seized upon me, and I pined
to be back in the press and throng of the busy world once again. I
went back to Paris, where I kept myself aloof from the court, and
where an angel took compassion upon me.

She was the daughter of an old comrade, a man whose merits had been
neglected, whose achievements had been ignored, and who sulked in his
shabby lodging like a rat in a hole, while all Paris went mad with the
Scotch Financier, and gentlemen and lacqueys were trampling one
another to death in the Rue Quin-campoix. The only child of this
little cross-grained old captain of dragoons was an incarnate sunbeam,
whose mortal name was Eveline Duchalet.

She loved me. The richest blessings of our lives are often those which
cost us least. I wasted the best years of my youth in the worship of a
wicked woman, who jilted and cheated me at last.

I gave this meek angel but a few courteous words--a little fraternal
tenderness--and lo, she loved me. The life which had been so dark and
desolate grew bright beneath her influence; and I went back to Puy
Verdun with a fair young bride for my companion.

Ah, how sweet a change there was in my life and in my home! The
village children no longer shrank appalled as the dark horseman rode
by, the village crones no longer crossed themselves; for a woman rode
by his side--a woman whose charities had won the love of all those
ignorant creatures, and whose companionship had transformed the gloomy
lord of the château into a loving husband and a gentle master. The old
retainers forgot the untimely fate of my cousin, and served me with
cordial willingness, for love of their young mistress.

There are no words which can tell the pure and perfect happiness of
that time. I felt like a traveller who had traversed the frozen seas
of an arctic region, remote from human love or human companionship, to
find himself on a sudden in the bosom of a verdant valley, in the
sweet atmosphere of home. The change seemed too bright to be real; and
I strove in vain to put away from my mind the vague suspicion that my
new life was but some fantastic dream.

So brief were those halcyon hours, that, looking back on them now, it
is scarcely strange if I am still half inclined to fancy the first
days of my married life could have been no more than a dream.

Neither in my days of gloom nor in my days of happiness had I been
troubled by the recollection of André's blasphemous oath.

The words which with his last breath he had whispered in my ear were
vain and meaningless to me. He had vented his rage in those idle
threats, as he might have vented it in idle execrations.

That he will haunt the footsteps of his enemy after death is the one
revenge which a dying man can promise himself; and if men had power
thus to avenge themselves, the earth would be peopled with phantoms.

I had lived for three years at Puy Verdun; sitting alone in the solemn
midnight by the hearth where he had sat, pacing the corridors that had
echoed his footfall; and in all that time my fancy had never so played
me false as to shape the shadow of the dead. Is it strange, then, if I
had forgotten Andre's horrible promise? There was no portrait of my
cousin at Puy Verdun. It was the age of boudoir art, and a miniature
set in the lid of a gold bonbonnière, or hidden artfully in a massivc
bracelet, was more fashionable than a clumsy life-size image, fit only
to hang on the gloomy walls of a provincial château rarely visited by
its owner. My cousin's fair face had adorned more than one
bonbonnière, and had been concealed in more than one bracelet; but it
was not among the faces that looked down from the panelled walls of
Puy Verdun.

In the library I found a picture which awoke painful associations. It
was the portrait of a De Brissac, who had flourished in the time of
Francis the First; and it was from this picture that my cousin Andre
had copied the quaint hunting-dress he wore at the Regent's ball. The
library was a room in which I spent a good deal of my life; and I
ordered a curtain to be hung before this picture.

We had been married three months, when Eveline one day asked, "Who is
the lord of the château nearest to this?"

I looked with her in astonishment.

"My dearest," I answered, "do you not know that there is no other
chateau within forty miles of Puy Verdun?"

"Indeed!" she said; "that is strange."

I asked her why the fact seemed strange to her; and after much
entreaty I obtained from her the reason of her surprise.

In her walks about the park and woods during the last month, she had
met a man who, by his dress and bearing, was obviously of noble rank.
She had imagined that he occupied some château near at hand, and that
his estate adjoined ours. I was at a loss to imagine who this stranger
could be; for my estate of Puy Verdun lay in the heart of a desolate
region, and unless when some traveller's coach went lumbering and
jingling through the village, one had little more chance of
encountering a gentleman than of meeting a demigod.

"Have you seen this man often, Eveline?" I asked.

She answered, in a tone which had a touch of sadness, "I see him every
day."

"Where, dearest?"

"Sometimes in the park, sometimes in the wood. You know the little
cascade, Hector, where there is some old neglected rock-work that
forms a kind of cavern. I have taken a fancy to that spot, and have
spent many mornings there reading. Of late I have seen the stranger
there every morning."

"He has never dared to address you?"

"Never. I have looked up from my book, and have seen him standing at a
little distance, watching me silently. I have continued reading; and
when I have raised my eyes again I have found him gone. He must
approach and depart with a stealthy tread, for I never hear his
footfall. Sometimes I have almost wished that he would speak to me. It
is so terrible to see him standing silently there."

"He is some insolent peasant who seeks to frighten you."

My wife shook her head.

"He is no peasant," she answered. "It is not by his dress alone I
judge, for that is strange to me. He has an air of nobility which it
is impossible to mistake."

"Is he young or old?"

"He is young and handsome."

I was much disturbed by the idea of this stranger's intrusion on my
wife's solitude; and I went straight to the village to inquire if any
stranger had been seen there. I could hear of no one. I questioned the
servants closely, but without result. Then I determined to accompany
my wife in her walks, and to judge for myself of the rank of the
stranger.

For a week I devoted all my mornings to rustic rambles with Eveline in
the park and woods; and in all that week we saw no one but an
occasional peasant in sabots, or one of our own household returning
from a neighbouring farm.

I was a man of studious habits, and those summer rambles disturbed the
even current of my life. My wife perceived this, and entreated me to
trouble myself no further.

"I will spend my mornings in the pleasaunce, Hector," she said; "the
stranger cannot intrude upon me there."

"I begin to think the stranger is only a phantasm of your own romantic
brain," I replied, smiling at the earnest face lifted to mine. "A
châtelaine who is always reading romances may well meet handsome
cavaliers in the woodlands. I daresay I have Mdlle. Scuderi to thank
for this noble stranger, and that he is only the great Cyrus in modern
costume."

"Ah, that is the point which mystifies me, Hector," she said. "The
stranger's costume is not modern. He looks as an old picture might
look if it could descend from its frame."

Her words pained me, for they reminded me of that hidden picture in
the library, and the quaint hunting costume of orange and purple,
which André de Brissac wore at the Regent's ball.

After this my wife confined her walks to the pleasaunce; and for many
weeks I heard no more of the nameless stranger. I dismissed all
thought of him from my mind, for a graver and heavier care had come
upon me. My wife's health began to droop. The change in her was so
gradual as to be almost imperceptible to those who watched her day by
day. It was only when she put on a rich gala dress which she had not
worn for months that I saw how wasted the form must be on which the
embroidered bodice hung so loosely, and how wan and dim were the eyes
which had once been brilliant as the jewels she wore in her hair.

I sent a messenger to Paris to summon one of the court physicians; but
I knew that many days must needs elapse before he could arrive at Puy
Verdun.

In the interval I watched my wife with unutterable fear.

It was not her health only that had declined. The change was more
painful to behold than any physical alteration. The bright and sunny
spirit had vanished, and in the place of my joyous young bride I
beheld a woman weighed down by rooted melancholy. In vain I sought to
fathom the cause of my darling's sadness. She assured me that she had
no reason for sorrow or discontent, and that if she seemed sad without
a motive, I must forgive her sadness, and consider it as a misfortune
rather than a fault.

I told her that the court physician would speedily find some cure for
her despondency, which must needs arise from physical causes, since
she had no real ground for sorrow. But although she said nothing, I
could see she had no hope or belief in the healing powers of medicine.

One day, when I wished to beguile her from that pensive silence in
which she was wont to sit an hour at a time, I told her, laughing,
that she appeared to have forgotten her mysterious cavalier of the
wood, and it seemed also as if he had forgotten her.

To my wonderment, her pale face became of a sudden crimson; and from
crimson changed to pale again in a breath.

"You have never seen him since you deserted your woodland grotto?" I
said.

She turned to me with a heart-rending look.

"Hector," she cried, "I see him every day; and it is that which is
killing me."

She burst into a passion of tears when she had said this. I took her
in my arms as if she had been a frightened child, and tried to comfort
her.

"My darling, this is madness," I said. "You know that no stranger can
come to you in the pleasaunce. The moat is ten feet wide and always
full of water, and the gates are kept locked day and night by old
Massou. The châtelaine of a mediæval fortress need fear no intruder in
her antique garden."

My wife shook her head sadly.

"I see him every day," she said.

On this I believed that my wife was mad. I shrank from questioning her
more closely concerning her mysterious visitant. It would be ill, I
thought, to give a form and substance to the shadow that tormented her
by too close inquiry about its look and manner, its coming and going.

I took care to assure myself that no stranger to the household could
by any possibility penetrate to the pleasaunce. Having done this, I
was fain to await the coming of the physician.

He came at last. I revealed to him the conviction which was my misery.
I told him that I believed my wife to be mad. He saw her--spent an
hour alone with her, and then came to me. To my unspeakable relief he
assured me of her sanity.

"It is just possible that she may be affected by one delusion," he
said; "but she is so reasonable upon all other points, that I can
scarcely bring myself to believe her the subject of a monomania. I am
rather inclined to think that she really sees the person of whom she
speaks. She described him to me with a perfect minuteness. The
descriptions of scenes or individuals given by patients afflicted with
monomania are always more or less disjointed; but your wife spoke to
me as clearly and calmly as I am now speaking to you. Are you sure
there is no one who can approach her in that garden where she walks?"

"I am quite sure."

"Is there any kinsman of your steward, or hanger-on of your
household,--a young man with a fair womanish face, very pale and
rendered remarkable by a crimson scar, which looks like the mark of a
blow?"

"My God!" I cried, as the light broke in upon me all at once. "And the
dress--the strange old-fashioned dress?"

"The man wears a hunting costume of purple and orange," answered the
doctor.

I knew then that André de Brissac had kept his word, and that in the
hour when my life was brightest his shadow had come between me and
happiness.

I showed my wife the picture in the library, for I would fain assure
myself that there was some error in my fancy about my cousin. She
shook like a leaf when she beheld it, and clung to me convulsively.

"This is witchcraft, Hector," she said. "The dress in that picture is
the dress of the man I see in the pleasaunce; but the face is not
his."

Then she described to me the face of the stranger; and it was my
cousin's face line for line---André de Brissac, whom she had never
seen in the flesh. Most vividly of all did she describe the cruel mark
upon his face, the trace of a fierce blow from an open hand.

After this I carried my wife away from Puy Verdun. We wandered far--
through the southern provinces, and into the very heart of
Switzerland. I thought to distance the ghastly phantom, and I fondly
hoped that change of scene would bring peace to my wife.

It was not so. Go where we would, the ghost of Andre de Brissac
followed us. To my eyes that fatal shadow never revealed itself. That
would have been too poor a vengeance. It was my wife's innocent heart
which Andre made the instrument of his revenge. The unholy presence
destroyed her life. My constant companionship could not shield her
from the horrible intruder. In vain did I watch her; in vain did I
strive to comfort her.

"He will not let me be at peace," she said; "he comes between us,
Hector. He is standing between us now. I can see his face with the red
mark upon it plainer that I see yours."

One fair moonlight night, when we were together in a mountain village
in the Tyrol, my wife cast herself at my feet, and told me she was the
worst and vilest of women. "I have confessed all to my director," she
said; "from the first I have not hidden my sin from Heaven. But I feel
that death is near me; and before I die I would fain reveal my sin to
you."

"What sin, my sweet one?"

"When first the stranger came to me in the forest, his presence
bewildered and distressed me, and I shrank from him as from something
strange and terrible. He came again and again; by and by I found
myself thinking of him, and watching for his coming. His image haunted
me perpetually; I strove in vain to shut his face out of my mind. Then
followed an interval in which I did not see him; and, to my shame and
anguish, I found that life seemed dreary and desolate without him.
After that came the time in which he haunted the pleasaunce; and--O,
Hector, kill me if you will, for I deserve no mercy at your hands!--I
grew in those days to count the hours that must elapse before his
coming, to take no pleasure save in the sight of that pale face with
the red brand upon it. He plucked all old familiar joys out of my
heart, and left in it but one weird unholy pleasure--the delight of
his presence. For a year I have lived but to see him. And now curse
me, Hector; for this is my sin. Whether it comes of the baseness of my
own heart, or is the work of witchcraft, I know not; but I know that I
have striven against this wickedness in vain."

I took my wife to my breast, and forgave her. In sooth, what had I to
forgive? Was the fatality that overshadowed us any work of hers? On
the next night she died, with her hand in mine; and at the very last
she told me, sobbing and affrighted, that he was by her side.
